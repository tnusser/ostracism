If you take a look at my [stats](http://bf3stats.com/stats_360/shotgunwookie#360), you will notice I play mostly as a medic and would like to stay in that role. My gun handling skills are top notch and I am very confident in my ability to drop anyone, anytime, anywhere in a straight gun fight. 

If I can't choose my own roster to try out for, I simply ask that I be put with a group of people who are at my level. I do not want to be the best person on a team that loses every time, I can go back to pubbing for that. 

Any questions about my stats or play style, just ask.

21,"Art being what it is, it's entirely subjective as to what's ""better"" or an ""improvement"". But I'll give you my two cents - why not, your work has entertained me hugely. Least I can do.

Now, uh, bear with me here.

In the comparison you linked, the 2012 painting has its own charm. Comparing it with newer works of yours, it has a suggestive feel to it, with dramatic yet certain effect. You can see this in, for example, your [Barrack Obama painting](http://i.imgur.com/Ju94o.png) also. There's a casual feel to it, but not one that's off-putting.

From there, you moved to more complete works, and started adding more detail. [This one](http://i.imgur.com/vBfnDfG.jpg) is an all time favourite of mine. It's got such a brilliant balance of simplicity and ""I don't care"" (whether that's ever been the case when you paint or not).

The obvious difference as time goes on is indeed your basic skill as a painter. Going back to the comparison you posted, you manage more even colour among other things. Which, even in rough paintings such as your ""Not Even Once"" piece, is a noticeable improvement.

Now, more recently still I think is where some were saying they preferred your older stuff. It looks to me like you've taken to adding much, much more detail here. You've moved further away from the ""I don't care"" feel of your paintings - I guess this removes a little bit of the fun from the whole idea of ""Shitty Watercolour"".

But

**Your direction as an artist shouldn't be forced. Improvement in skill is one thing, but your style is another.** While the effect of your posts is less comedy now, I appreciate setting some time aside to look at some really quite nice pieces like [this](http://i.imgur.com/LTNrrSk.jpg), [this](http://i.imgur.com/1g2Leg2.jpg) and another personal favourite, [this](http://i.imgur.com/ynQe4.jpg). With your newer content which you stick up on other medias, I find your newer stuff has an illustrator's flare to it, and I like that in the kind of art you do.

**TL;DR, You've changed styles. It's less humour and more real, detailed art now. And that's fine, in fact I prefer it - but that's what I'm after when I look at art. If you want to maintain the humour, your 2012-13 style was probably best with that effect.**",CaptHunter,1414287624.0,Sun Oct 26 02:40:24 2014,5.0,no mod,"2,409,827",1,3318.0,0.0

I can tell you his math is wrong though.  If you have a budget of $300 and it costs you $0.50 per 1,000 impressions then you would get 600,000 impressions on your budget.  With a 1.5% CTR or click through rate this would yield you 9,000 visitors at $0.033 per visitor.

1.5% CTR may be high with this type of advertising depending on many factors.  You may need to test out many banners, ad networks, and the way you target your audience.

65,">Of course, it is possible that your circle of people are just a bunch of freaks and statistical outliers, but it's pretty unlikely. The average credit card debt of the average American is $15,799 per household.

That is incorrect.

Assuming spending habits haven't drastically changed since 2007, fewer than half of American households hold credit card debt. That's not to say they don't have credit cards; about 75% of households have credit cards, but 40% of them do not keep a balance. Of the Americans holding credit card debt, the median balance per household is $3,000.

[Source: Fed 2009 SCF](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2009/pdf/scf09.pdf), page A40-A41, ""Family holdings of debt"". Also, pages A45-A46, ""Credit Card Balances and Other Lines of Credit"".

That corroborates with my personal experience as well, where a majority of people pay off their statements monthly. (In reality, probably closer to half because people who are knee-deep in debt probably don't start the ""let's talk finances"" discussion with me as often.)

Believe me I have heard political exchanges like this before and this new info will be used to push that argument more. The new info will help those who can afford to follow another set of rules added to pregnancy. Now think of the minimum wage worker who can not afford to alter their life as they have bills to pay. Think of the professional women whose job's demands would go against the new rules and if she follows the new rules bye- bye career. These 2 women would be at fault for harming their child as far as libertarians view it.

>Why now?
>Nearly one billion people go to bed hungry every night and two million children die from malnutrition every year. We've made progress in other areas, but hunger is still the great scandal of our age. All around the world, even in the UK, people are struggling to feed their families.

>In 2013, the government has promised to provide 0.7% of national income for aid and to host a Hunger Summit. We must make sure they keep these promises. In June, the world’s most powerful leaders will meet in the UK at the G8.

>This is our best opportunity to tackle hunger. We must make IF happen.

 

>What’s happening in 2013?
You can find a timeline of the key moments in the Enough Food For Everyone IF campaign in our Get Involved section.

 

>What do we want?
We want our leaders to act on the four big issues that mean so many people do not get enough food. 

>Aid

>Enough Food For Everyone IF we give enough aid to stop children dying from hunger and help the poorest families feed themselves.

>Tax

>Enough Food For Everyone IF governments stop big companies dodging tax in poor countries.

>Land

>Enough Food For Everyone IF we stop poor farmers being forced off their land and grow crops to feed people, not fuel cars.

>Transparency

>Enough Food For Everyone IF governments and big companies are honest and open about their actions that stop people getting enough food.

>Together, we can make IF happen.

>The more of us who get involved, then the greater pressure there will be on world leaders to tackle global hunger in 2013.

171,"This is something I have given much thought to.

In the context of health, there are some actions that are amenable to measurements like vaccination and drug distribution. Others like health education and behaviour change though effective are much less *measureable* but more effective. 

I know it sounds confusing, hope you get my drift.

Ok, let me explain more, think of poor communities in India and the targetted polio eradication program. The genaral vaccination rates are low across the board for all diseases. Now under this targetted polio program you can easily calculate the cost of each vaccine dose, protection rates and lives saved. But since some communities do not favour the idea of vaccination (that is why you had low vaccination rates initially). So a program to change this unhealthy behaviour is better but less easily measureable in terms of bang for the buck!

Interestingly that is the reason there is more funding for vaccination and malaria programs as they are better measured and give quick results. ",i_am_scared_of_truth,1325248216.0,Fri Dec 30 13:30:16 2011,1.0,no mod,413070,0,1611.0,0.0

262,"This is a perfect scenario. It doesn't take into account the weapons, it relies on everyone working together and knowing their place (which in my opinion wouldn't have RU ending up outside anyway). 

Also the distro of US forces seems different than what I usually see, you place 3 in the Kiosk during your phase 1 but usually there may only be 1-2 with the others on the side enterance. 

The problems with pushing inside against a competent force:

The glare, you cannot see inside as well as they can see the outside. This is a good thing as it reflects real-life effects.

There is hardly any cover and the shape of the outside gives all outside-round angles of approach. I'll try to clarify with some examples- on the side enterance, there is no cover and to enter the RU side must navigate a sharp 90 degree turn to US forces that are in cover. Center enterance you have a direct approach but the only cover (the bus) is off to the side and of no use to provide supression. However for the US they not only have the blind corner (the dead end where someone usually drops with a PK or other LMG), but also the Kiosk and L-wall. The 3rd enterance is a complete joke, a set of sliding doors with no cover, a blind corner to run, and on the inside you have a blind wall plus an LMG covering the sector of fire.


to be honest, If the US team has even a slight intelligence and foresight to not push for A, they can win every time by just making sure they cover the enterances and revive.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but if no major mistakes are made RU will have a bad time.

I don't consent to the taking of my money, therefore it is theft.

266,"A few reasons I can think of off the top of my head,

* In the US, unions have a reputation for violence and vandalism. In my city, the head of the ironworkers union and a bunch of members were just arrested for several crimes including setting fire to a nonunion construction project, and assaulting nonunion workers with baseball bats. There are also historical ties between unions and organized crime. On a lesser scale, it's very common for unions to picket construction sites simply for using nonunion labor, and spread a lot of propaganda, which rubs some people the wrong way.

* In some cases, unions are harmful to their industries. The US auto industry is a good example, they demanded so much money and so many pensions that American cars became very expensive to produce, foreign cars got a hold in the market, and eventually a lot of these car companies went bankrupt.

* There's also a lot of ties between unions and the Democratic party, so a lot of Republicans don't like them on that principal. Also as far as politics go there are laws that will protect unions at the cost of individual workers, like a lot of places have what's called closed shop laws. Basically that means that if employees of an establishment vote to unionize, union membership becomes a mandatory condition of employment, and your employer is legally obligated to fire you for not participating in the union. I'm in a union like that, admittedly my union is pretty crappy and for a lot of people the advantages of being in the union are not at all worth the dues, but they don't have a choice.",None,1395185619.0,Wed Mar 19 00:33:39 2014,2.0,none,"419,772",1,,

Within seconds the SC&P building is reduced to rubble. All of our favourite characters are being taken and harvested for their organs by the aliens. Pete Campbell is the last man standing, that is, until Bob vaporizes him. All hope seemed lost until... 

We cut to a lavish apartment in L.A. where the invasion is being broadcast through a TV set. A shady figure reaches for his face and pulls of... a pair of glasses. The man says ""Now it's personal"" and none other than HARRY fucking CRANE, rips open his hawaiian shirt to reveal that he... is SUPERMAN! 

Harry bursts through the ceiling, and jets towards NY. Upon arrival he meets Bob Benson, who is holding the remains of the once great Don Draper. Bob claims ""it's over you fool! Soon we will take over your entire planet!"". Harry's eyes glow red with rage as he says ""I am no fool"" and destroys Bob and his alien comrades with blistering heat vision. Harry pulls Don from the aftermath. In his final breath Don says ""We should have made you partner"". As Don perishes in his arms, Harry Crane soars skywards, into the wonders of space.

457,"You only need the 2500k+cooler if you're overclocking, otherwise a 2400 with the stock cooler is way more than enough for gaming. Or as Manirelli stated, choose the 2600k for its hyperthreading/slightly bigger cache.

850w is a lot for a single-card system, or even a crossfireX setup considering the remarkable power draw of the 7000 series. 600w will be plenty, 700-750 for crossfire and/or overclocking in the future - but good choice with Corsair, their PSUs are pretty reliable.

There's a shitton of debate about the 4gb-8gb-16gb amounts of RAM, but if you're doing heavy video/design stuff then by all means get it - it's not that expensive in the overall setup.

I'd recommend the M4 Corsair SSDs over the Force 3s, but that's just personal opinion. It's about $70 more for the 128gb model.

I uploaded the high resolution version to Google Drive, because it's nearly 30MB, I hope it works:

https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwI-mTBthmB3RWRSa1FYM2dfQUk

The announcement is that, despite the fact that I've only just finished painting the last load of requests, it's possible that I'm going to be doing another charity fundraiser. The details aren't finalised, but the process will be the same except that the finished painting will end up on the set of a very popular TV show for the remainder of the season, and there may be an extra bonus if their target is met. This fundraiser would be for a different charity, and it will happen very soon if it goes ahead. 

I will update with more information when it's confirmed, and if you want to keep track of it then you should follow me on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/swatercolour) or sub to [r/shitty_watercolour](http://www.reddit.com/r/shitty_watercolour)

672,"Exactly. This is the exact issue that has been plaguing both /r/science and /r/askscience. If there is even a small joke, or if **they** see it as off topic, they will delete it without hesitation. All their practice of mass-deleting comments has so much room for error I honestly don't feel comfortable participating in their discussions. I've heard heard the argument of, ""If they don't complain it's fine"" but this is inaccurate as they have just literally deleted their comment and when they see a whole scroll of [deleted] it really makes you not want to do anything. I also hate when they allow the comment, ""Just Google it"" which I've seen allowed more than once.

Kudos to these mods. Actually listening to their subscribers and making sure they moderate in moderation according to what they want. :)

/r/computing : I've had an interest in computers and tech since forever and have built my own rigs for years. I keep up with whats going on in the computer/ tech world and am fairly knowledgeable.

/r/fascinating: I've only just discovered just now but well it is fascinating ;) I'd love to help build it up so it has more content and help it grow.

755,"I mod /r/news, would love to also moderate /r/worldnews. 

- /r/news has about 100k subscribers, so about 1/10th the number for worldnews; the content is similar, and the rules are similar. (Very simple: 1: it must be a news item.  2: no editorializing in the headlines). 

- I've never banned a person, ever.  There have been incidents where I've removed comments for being abusive, or where I've had to remind people to mind their manners. 

- I do remove posts.  With every post I explicitly remove, I post a comment explaining the reason. Even if the reason is already explained in the sidebar, it helps to be explicit about it in a message with specific details. (for example, ""Your headline was fine, until the part where you wrote, *WTF?  Reddit, we need to stop this now!*"")  I often encourage people to re-post without the editorialized headline. In some cases I discourage reposts, explaining that both the headline and the item linked are inappropriate. 

- I've never had an argument or disagreement with a co-moderator on /r/news regarding a post.  In my experience, the other mods are level headed and thoughtful, they don't need me second-guessing their actions. When the rules are simple and clear and explicit, it makes for easy co-moderation.

- I have had one or two users that have reacted negatively to my decisions to remove or not unblock their posts. I don't engage in arguments with such people, though I do take the time to respond substantively to their concerns, and clearly explain why I did what I did. If they feel very strongly, and are unsatisfied with my explanation, I direct them to appear to the other mods. For example, once I removed a comment towards me that was abusive, and I explained why. The original poster complained, due to the perceived conflict of interest. I directed him to appeal to the other mods. I keep it professional and non-emotional at all times. 

- my approach as a mod is to blend into the background. The best mod is an invisible one. From time to time I post a longer comment in which I describe the mods approach, and what people ought to do if they find a thread that is objectionable. (Report, and/or message the mods explaining why). 

- I don't stand in the way of arguments that may arise in comment streams, but from time to time I step in and remind people to be civil to each other.",AyeMatey,1326141389.0,Mon Jan  9 21:36:29 2012,-3.0,mod,413070,0,31598.0,0.0

890,"There's a lot I could say in response to this article, but I'll leave it at this: The greatest problem I have consistently witnessed among Christians seeking to comment upon Christian-Jewish-Muslim relations in Israel and the Palestinian Territories is **a)** the persistent lack of historical, theological wherewithal coupled with **b)** a persistent yen to centrally locate oneself in the story and **c)** a sub-critical application of the concepts of justice that drive the discussion. This is the thread running through Late Antiquity, the first wave of Muslim control during the reign of Caliph Omar and Caliph Abd al-Malik, the Christian crusades followed by Salah a-Din's rejoinder, the period of Egyptian Malmuk rule, the Turkish Ottoman period, the Western resurgence of interest leading to the Balfour Declaration and British protectorate, and even the United Nations' partition plan yielding the contemporary situation with the formation of the modern State of Israel (dominant Jewish leadership at the time accepting and thereby benefiting from the plan) and the Palestinian Territories (dominant Muslim leadership at the time rejecting and thereby suffering from the plan).

How many Christian speak to present conditions in Israel with an almost complete lack of knowledge regarding what occurred during each of the periods I described immediately above? I'd warrant that the majority do; in fact, the majority have never even heard of about 50% of the contents of the last sentence in the immediately preceding paragraph. What is troubling is that this lack of historical command has been coupled with an official position of theological hostility towards the Jewish people for about 90% of the Church's existence. As I recently shared in response to [an excellent post by SyntheticSylence on the topic of ""Christian Love and Shades of Anti-Semitism,""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Catacombs/comments/s79v5/christian_love_and_shades_of_antisemitism/) anti-Judaic and anti-Semitic streams of thought in Christianity predate the famous cases about which all of us know, like Luther's On the Jews and Their Lies (for the uninitiated, critical introduction and excerpts [here](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Luther_on_Jews.html) with the whole shebang [here](http://www.humanitas-international.org/showcase/chronography/documents/luther-jews.htm)) or the pogroms or the Nazi holocaust: 

> Attempts by influential albeit heretical teachers in the early Church, like [Marcion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism), to treat the God of the Old Testament as being different from the God of the New come to mind, not to mention [the propagation of supercessionism as an official, strategic response to the non-believing Jewish community](http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj19c.pdf#page=4) by Church fathers from Irenaeus to Clement to Tertullian to Origen to Cyprian--the idea being that the crime of the Jews rejection of Jesus was so heinous that God had rejected them and replaced them with the Church.

It is *that* theological climate that made the Crusades possible. Moreover, [the prominence of a ""missions by diffusion"" paradigm based on Luke 14:23's ""compel them to come in” clause](http://66.147.254.48/assets/files/10guder.pdf#page=6) made it possible to sensibly *force* the gospel upon another rather than winsomely translate it, yielding a time of greater brutality against **both** the Jewish and Muslim communities in Israel for roughly a thousand years before and a thousand years after the fact. Ironically, we risk repeating this mistake when we sub-critically support present conditions in Israel or sub-critically oppose the same because we neglect the difficult task of coping with the cultural nuances in play in order to effectively speak truth to power and act for justice--we simply impose our own theological framework upon the situation and call the shots as we see them.

Even when Christians attempt to address the very legitimate claims of asymmetric power wielded against the Palestinian community, we do so from a place of consistently locating Christians at the center of that story. Notice how the article begins with the very truthful statement that Palestinian Muslims and Palestinian Christians cope with similarly problematic treatment; by the end of the narrative, there is no more discussion about the Muslim community--just the plight of those poor Christians who cannot get the permissions they desire (with, I would add, absolutely no critical commentary on whether a state of affairs calling for permission-based passage is for the best give present conditions). The article begins with a diatribe against the power wielded by the ""Jewish State,"" omitting the fact that [both Druze and Arabs help comprise the Knesset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arab_members_of_the_Knesset)! Notice the complete lack of attention to the United Nations' agency in the partition plan--no, it is just those Jews who are making life difficult for our Palestinian brothers and sisters. The irony of the articles concluding third bemoaning the difficulty of expanding its campus is striking.

Finally and most importantly, I will tip my hand and self-identify as an American--[nearly 50% of us on Reddit are](http://www.snoosecret.com/statistics-about-reddit.html). Every single day, I live at a greater degree of wealth and comfort than almost any other group of people on earth due to genocidal activity my nation sustained upon both the indigenous population of this land as well as the African American community. Where are the persistent cries for reparations and empowered liberty for our Native American and black brothers and sisters? Where is the drive for justice at the politically, socio-economically substantial level? Why are we so fixated on the conditions of a country roughly the size of the state of New Jersey with a [population](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_pop_totl&idim=country:ISR&dl=en&hl=en&q=israel+population) smaller than [New York City](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&met_y=population&idim=place:3651000&dl=en&hl=en&q=new+york+metro+area+population) alone when our special brand of injustice stretches from ""sea to shining sea""--and further still. At least with the case of Israel and Palestine, there has been an attempt at international mediation; over 100 years *after* the founding of my nation, [a maverick group of Americans overthrew a sovereign republic that became our 50th state!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hawaii) 

Yes, we should seek justice in the case of the Palestinian Territories and the State of Israel. But our attempts to do this will amount to very little of lasting worth if we do not apply ourselves to the task of gaining a better theological, historical perspective, a less ego-centric need to be the hero of the story, and an appropriately critical outlook that works *even harder on our own turf* for the sort of justice we hope to see abroad.

Only naive idiots believe or trust them, many of them on reddit.

Iran is too stupid about the whole thing: if they stopped threatening to destroy Israel every day and if they complied with the NPT necessary inspections, then they could have their nuclear plants (for civil use) by now... and then quickly after that, if they wanted, convert them for nuclear weaponry.

Luckily, like a typical stupid criminal, they give all the reason to suspect them... er, to believe they are up-to-no-good.

Hence, the whole world is boycotting them. So, I hope the world continue to strike Iran, in greater force, to make sure no chance of nuclear weapons in the hands of those crazies. Israel already did enough covert operation in Iran to make prevent that.

985,"> Does spell scrolls can be used only once? Im playing Ranger and it comes with 3 spell scrolls which are Fire, Sparkling and Poison arrow. I use them once and it's gone!?

They are single-use. They have are a way to cast a spell without having learned it, and so they are consumable to limit their power and keep casters relevant. 
> Playing as Ranger, there are only 3 skills available at the beginning. How do I open up/learn new skills?

You buy or find skill books. You have to have points in the pertinent ability. I assume for Ranger you should look for some Marksmanship skill books.
> How do I unlock other classes and their skills?

After character creation, the game is pretty much class-less. Your abilities and skills are defined by what you put points into, what skills you learn and the equipment you wear. It's hard and inconvenient, but technically if you decide to turn into a knight, you can start putting points into man-at-arms and strength instead of marksmanship and dexterity.

Of course this becomes less and less feasible the more you level up, and would only cripple you in both types of combat, but it's still technically possible.

This is all from what I've learned so far by playing the game, so if anyone has any corrections or additions, feel free to comment.",Karma-Koala,1404350827.0,Thu Jul  3 03:27:07 2014,3.0,mod,"419,772",1,467.0,0.0

995,"I copied OP's post, here it is since she deleted it. (For the Ctrl-f people: mirror, copy, removed) 

>What else can I do to make sure my son with SSA (same sex attractions) remains on the right path? How can I stop being so afraid for him?

>Hi all. I've been a longtime lurker on this sub, so I know that there is some difference of opinion about the morality of homosexual acts here (that's also why I'm using a throwaway account for this).  For my part, I hew to the catechism of the Catholic church on this topic, and I'm not here to get into a big ugly debate about the merits of her position on this issue.  I'm just looking for practical advice with a difficult situation I find our family in with my son.

>First, I should give a little background. My husband and I are the proud parents of 4 boys, aged 17, 19, 22, and 24.  Our eldest son is happily married and expecting his first child in a few months, and our middle sons are in college now, so our youngest is the only one still living at home with us full-time.  

>Three years ago, he came to us in tears and said he had to tell us something important, but he was afraid of what our reaction would be.  We assured him he could tell us anything, and then he said the four words that turned our lives upside-down, ""Mom, Dad, I'm gay.""  

>After we got over our initial shock (and I had taken some time to grieve the loss of my dreams of his one day having a family), we sat him down and told him that we loved him, and that what he had told us wouldn't change that in the slightest.  We made it clear that we understood that same sex attraction isn't a choice, and that it's not likely to go away.  But we also stressed that same sex attraction is an objective tendency towards sin, and that resisting it will be a lifelong cross he will have to bear - that all are called to chastity, and that means only sexual activity in the context of a lifelong marriage between one man and one woman is permitted, period. People like him who find themselves unsuitable for marriage are called to be celibate. We told him that God abhors sin, and a sexual relationship with another male will only serve to lead him away from salvation, and that we could therefore never support or accept him if he chooses to pursue one.  At the time, he told us that though it made him very sad, he understood that that was true, and asked us to help him accept his lot in life.

>So we did.  We took him to our parish priest, who agreed to counsel him about his temptations on a regular basis.  We were very strict about insisting that he go to confession regularly (it's something we left to our older sons' discretion, but we figured that he would need to be held to a higher standard of accountability with his disordered attractions).  We also set up other defenses for his chastity: we pulled him off of the basketball team (the locker room would just be an unnecessary temptation, and his presence there would be inappropriate and unfair to the other boys in his situation).  We took the door off of his bedroom since privacy would just tempt him to experiment in the ways teen boys tend to do, and we forbid him from having sleepovers or spending one-on-one time with any of his male friends unsupervised (of course, the same rules apply to female friends, but that's a rule we impose on all our sons).  Since romantic relationships can never be a part of his life, we also forbid him from dating (girls, obviously), or participating in activities like his high school prom.  We've locked down the family computer with browsing filters, and, unlike our other sons, we never allowed him to have a cell phone, since he might use it to access inappropriate and confusing images. 

>Our son has often told my husband and me that he feels very lonely, and that it's devastating that he'll never be able to be in love or have a family. He went through a bout of depression after our oldest married, since he knows that's something he'll never be able to have, and that he'll never be able to make us proud and happy that way.  But we were always very firm in explaining that coping with loneliness and envy are always going to be a part of his life, given his disorder - that he needs to accept the hand he's been dealt, and that God will help him if he asks. We've always told him that carrying his cross and living chastely is enough to make us proud. And our careful supervision and rules have kept him from succumbing to temptation so far. 

>But now that he's getting ready to apply to colleges, I'm very afraid of what's going to happen to him once he doesn't have our constant support and guidance.  I'm terrified that he'll succumb to loneliness or depression and seek out a disordered relationship to numb his brokenness when he's off on his own.  We've made it clear that we will withdraw our financial support of his studies if we ever find that he is not living up to God's standards for sexuality, but I know that we won't really be able to keep tabs on him when he's away - that he might seek to satisfy his sinful urges covertly, either through pornography and self-abuse, or worse, with another confused young man.  What else can I do to impress upon him the gravity of his situation, how his soul hangs in the balance here?  And how will I ever be able to trust that my son will resist his dangerous temptations for the rest of his life?  How can I be free of this anxiety I have for him?",stropharia,1438360005.0,Fri Jul 31 18:26:45 2015,8.0,no mod,"1,398,796",1,71.0,0.0

Sometimes, I'll get a taste of it. The simple inkling in my mind of a world that used to be normal, full of joy, full of It. But as the words escape from my mind, I sadden at the thought that soon, we will not have it at all.

And then I think to all He has done for us, sitting up there in the sky for us to praise.

And so I sing, ""Ohh, Gravity, stay the hell away from me.""

1065,"My sister was physically ill for a few days, so ill that it kept her out of school. Finally it got so bad that my parents brought her into the hospital. Turns out she had Supraventricular (I think I spelled that right) Tachycardia. Basically what was happening to her was that her heart was beating at over 200 BPM and wouldn't slow down. There are two or three (I can't remember) nodes along the surface of your heart that help control your heart rate. When you're a baby, you have a lot of these nodes on your heart that eventually dissolve when you get older, but in my sister's case, those nodes didn't dissolve. Strangely, a lot of young athletes like my sister have this condition. A year before my sister was diagnosed, a young man in another school had the same symptoms and just simply tipped over and died after a cross country match.

1116,"Here are some observations I picked up from the Gamespot video, if there are any you want to add to the main post


* No radio beacon for recon? 

* Gadgets in general are now much less restricted, namely, you could carry mines and repair tool at the same time (losing your launcher in the process)

* DMR rifles for all classes (confirmed for engi) - this was one of the oldest rumours out there

* Muzzle break - less recoil, more spread

* It was very fast in the video but it looks like the side mounted iron sight would replace lasers

* Angled grip - better initial recoil

* Foregrip - better movement while aiming

* Climbing ladders looks faster

* Knife swipes are in, recovery may be a hair faster than BF3?

* 25 point melee bonus

* Vehicle mobility hit is worth 50 points, could be similear to a disable

* at 7:40 the tank is destroyed while underground, by the commander of the other team. Before that kill is shown you assume that the tank was C4'd... the obvious answer is the tomahawk, so maybe it has the ability to pierce ceilings? Or, just heavy splash damage.

* Can still reload while sprinting

* Vehicle Spawn Bonus 25

* Squad Spawn Bonus 50 (not sure if these last two are always linked when a squad mate spawns on you in a vehicle)  - a regular squad spawn as infantry is still 10 points

* Controllable  shuttergates confirmed

* ""Critical Damage / Low Power"" on the tank HUD when taking an RPG to the rear that brought health to 45 - HUD goes static-y at dangerously low health (16) 

* A multi kill was worth 200 in addition to the 100 x 2 for the kills for a total of 450 points with the vehicle destroy",megadan76,1371148474.0,Thu Jun 13 20:34:34 2013,3.0,no mod,114934,0,1859.0,0.0

1163,"What I really, really like about your recent paintings is the very clear linework and less overall sloppyness and coloration, but I guess it has gotten a bit less cartoony/bold, i.e. more outlines in general, less bold shading, and more detail overall.

While I really like the feel of your newer paintings, I think a lot of the innocence of earlier works has gone away, which was kinda inevitable though. I'd say your newer works are generally better, as I find that you've slowly but surely found your own style, which is really great in my opinion!

Personally, I'd really like to see what you could do with keeping the general mood of your newer works (especially the mood in those paintings you linked in the OP here), but trying out some of the bolder outlines and less detailed colorations you did in 2013, but of course less sloppy and thus cleaner.

As for favorites, I always really like the paintings where you take up classics but put your unique spin on them, like in the 2014 painting in that comparison in the OP.

1170,"As an American, I endorse this method. If we're going to be candid and recognize the jockeying for power, influence, and resources that is, in reality, going on, then taking this path seems to me to be much more moral than the other route (that we seem to love taking).

On a macro level, when you look at the percentage of world resources that we consume relative to our population, you have to ask yourself ""Is this sustainable?""  In a sense, we did it to ourselves. In our quest to line the pockets of our mega-corporations, we have pushed the philosophy of capitalism and free trade to the logical extreme. Our religion of globalization has gutted manufacturing from our economy, and moved it wherever on the globe where the lowest labor rates imaginable exist, lifting their poorest there out of complete poverty (with the requisite disproportionate wealth flow to the wealthiest few), and then moving on to the next country. As these middle classes continue to flourish in the worlds most populace countries (China now, India next), I just don't see how, as Americans, we can expect to have so few (US) take in so many of the world's resources for our consumption. Their appetites will mirror ours, no?


I think our consumption is unsustainable. I think we are in the process of becoming victims of *our* economic philosophy that stopped serving our nation once it was applied on a macro, global scale, and instead serves corporate constructs which can (and will, and do) exist anywhere, without regard to nation. I *hope* that our response to this decreasing slice of the pie will not be what it has been (nakedly invading Iraq in an attempt to secure oil for instance), but I'm not sure how much faith I have in our government to do that.

1245,"American schools need to reinvent themselves and there are some good teachers to help with that, but the Bush II-created No Child Left Behind legislation has made a large part of the school year focused on teaching to the test. A teacher can't be too creative and try innovative techniques, much less teach controversial topics like political history, when their school's reputation and their job rides on how well students do on their Standards of Learning tests. It's a real shame because we're still the leader in many areas of education, early childhood, learning disabilities, and college level education, but if you're in between, you're likely to fall behind the rest of the world.

I live in Fairfax County, VA, one of the best school districts in the United States, and I have two of my three kids in the Spanish Immersion program so they're challenged by something other than passing the yearly tests. We're a pretty wealthy district, with many highly educated parents, but it still comes down to helping those who need it most, e.g. those with Autism or Down Syndrome, and offering gifted and other advanced courses for those who need a challenge, but if you're in the middle, from a little slow to somewhat above average, you just slide through. I have a daughter in high school here and she's basically just coasted through her education, learning the basics but not being inspired in her core classes. And this is in one of the top school districts in the country. I know most are far worse off.

Add to this the fact that Americans tend more to religious extremism than other developed nations and the religious (Christians and Muslims especially) tend to consider everything that doesn't square with their beliefs a threat. They spend a lot of energy trying to ban books that raise the ideas of homosexuality, question belief in gods, etc. As a Humanist, this is particularly frustrating. My kids are well adapted to dealing with others who try to push their religious beliefs, but the number of people who are threatened by and react against anything that questions their invisible man in the sky belief system ensures that nothing really controversial (e.g. socialism or Marxism) is taught in American schools. Heck, we're still fighting to keep creationism out of science class! I'm sure we look like to Europeans like a pretty backward culture in some ways, and I have to agree.

TLDR - American schools are too constrained by conservative/regressive American culture to teach anything like socialism or Marxism.

1255,"Hi, my name is Matthew and I own an SEO agency in the US. (Don't worry I'm not trying to sell you anything -- you really only want to choose someone to does SEO who is in your country).

To answer your questions, here are some thoughts:

1. SEO guys are not web developers. If the SEO guy is doing it, it will probably look like crap -- and convert like crap. If the SEO company has a designer on staff, they are probably pushing it as a loss leader to get the SEO contract. He doesn't look big enough for that, so I would expect he's going to give you a wordpress site with some lousy theme rather than your own design.

2. He's right that you can't really rank for any competitive keywords with a flash site, google has always had trouble crawling flash. Even though they say they can now, it's only some of the flash content and they still downrank it because not everyone who uses google has flash.

3. He's wrong that a wordpress site is the answer. Google loves wordpress -- but only for a blog!!! Use regular old html or php files with content that google can crawl. Avoid CMS's. Worpress is like the online equivalent of a newstand -- it's meant for current, constantly changing content. If you want to rank for anything competitive (in general, keyword phrases that are less than 3 words), don't use something that is meant for time-sensitive material. With a regular site, you gain more ""google juice"" the longer you have been around, with wordpress (news) content, your ""juice"" will decrease the longer you have been around.

4. I don't know what you are selling, so I can't say this definitively, but 1.5% clickthrough rate on a banner ad is dramatically unrealistic for most industries. Really, unless you are giving something away or have a world class ad buyer, this sounds like a ton of crap.

5. He is right that some clients who wish to make money initially choose to do advertising, but they usually choose to do this with adwords not banner ads because banner ads tend to give tons of ""bad"" traffic (If you ask me, I think a lot of it is fake, as the content producer feels he has an obligation to hit that 1.5% mark...).

6. FREEBEE: Don't do adwords advertising until you have gotten your first PR (PageRank) given out by google. Your Google adwords bid is basically price * quality score (a 1 - 10 value) if your bid is higher than your competitors you will be above them. It seems that google gives out a quality score around the same time as PageRank. If google hasn't given you a quality score, they assume you have a bad one. Save yourself the money and advertise after you have a quality score, especially if you think you might forget about altering it after you get one.

7. He's wrong that advertising early is a good idea -- or a revolutionary one. Most people do this -- and lose money (again, if they are in a competitive niche -- if you are selling a local service in a small town, you probably could do SEO yourself). Advertising on adwords can be very expensive, and requires constant monitoring and a full usability analysis. The general rule is to test your conversion ratios on free traffic until it has reached a rate where (conversion ration * average profit on sale > advertising click cost * 100)

8. No SEO guy has any idea what you sales conversion ratios will ever be. Nor has he even the possibility to change that, save getting you relevant traffic. Remember: he doesn't control your product or it's price. A business partner and I own the third ranking site for ""security camera;"" I wish our conversion ratios were 1%. 

I hope this helps.",mnederlanden,1295808971.0,Sun Jan 23 19:56:11 2011,6.0,mod,114934,0,7090.0,0.0

1317,"I'd love to have a conversation about the mechanics of reddit as it pertains to /r/Australia, Evadregand, ala /r/theoryofreddit.  Is that possible without it becoming political?  I'd love to shift gears away from the current squabbles and start a conversation about what /r/Australia **could** be.

My whole philosophy revolves around community involvement in national subreddits.  When you say:

>... but this conspiracy stuff is just nuts.

... I have to try to decipher what you see as nutty in what I'm saying.  There's nothing sinister behind your removal of duplicate posts, and if your community voted on such a policy, together with all other policies that make up the underpinnings of the subreddit, then I would have absolutely no problem with it.  

As it stands you're removing 'duplicates' which sometimes are links to different stories in different newspapers.  Sometimes you remove duplicate submissions which are hours old with established discussions still ongoing.  Sometimes you'll remove discussions on the same story because a discussion had already been had twenty-four hours before.  Sometimes, mostly with the old ausbot, you'd remove discussions that had absolutely no relationship to another news story.  All of these submissions disappear, taking their discussions with them.

Discussion should be the focus of your moderation.  People at a party can split off into groups and all be discussing the same thing.  You may want to discuss a story with a certain group of people, or you may not want to join a discussion which has been raging for hours and in which you are unlikely to have your opinion heard.

People can choose which submission they'd like to join.  All they need is a link to the previous discussion to let them know that there may already be an existing thread available.  You spent a good portion of your time as a civilian redditor making links to duplicates.  That's all that is required.  Removing these submissions is dismissing the involvement of someone trying to interact with their community.

But my opinion really doesn't matter.  What matters is the opinion of everyone else who makes this subreddit what it is.  Start discussions on everything that has a rule associated with it.  Keep those discussions going, all the time.  Start a metareddit if need be, and invite a never-ending discussion on how the subreddit is run.",ArchiveLibrarian,1412074026.0,Tue Sep 30 12:47:06 2014,6.0,mod,413070,0,173.0,0.0

1524,"> ATI is recommended mostly, why? Benefits over Nvidia?

They've got their whole new lineup out, while nVidia only has the enthusiast GPU ($500) out from their new line. That means on mid-range and low end GPU's, AMD's offering is more powerful for the same price. Unless you're looking at CUDA hardware accelerated software, both brands are a good choice at equal performance.

> 4gb of RAM is always recommended as the most needed, why?

Not sure I really understand the question. Going over 4Gb RAM in common usage is relatively easy with a lot of applications running, and 8Gb are dirt cheap, so the overwhelming majority of people choose to get more than 4Gb.

> I hear people suggesting getting 16gb and putting it on your pagefile, benefits of that?

Again, not sure I understand. The page file is there to help the system cope if you run out of RAM, disabling the page file is something you can opt to do when you have a large amount of RAM, but you can just as well move it to a hard drive, not to mention that some programs will flat out refuse to work without a page file present.",Shoune,1333318099.0,Mon Apr  2 00:08:19 2012,3.0,mod,114934,0,127.0,0.0

It's currently very awkward to access the server logs for a variety of reasons.

The difference in payout luck is based on several factors, location, play traffic, and the greediness of the owner. 

We had certain locations such as full on arcades that saw lot's of play traffic, so the payouts were reasonably low because of the required upkeep for an offsite technician (onsite techs = higher payouts in most cases.), then there were machines in preferential bars that had many regulars and repeat customers where payout was much higher in order to maintain loyalty.

1734,"There will be 41 PCCs elected, compared with 573 MPs (going down soon). A better comparison is with MEPs, of which England and Wales have 63. The deposit for European elections is also £5,000, so I imagine this figure was chosen on the same basis. I assume it will have a similar threshold for recovery of the deposit (5% iirc).

That said, as someone who does work for a small political party, these deposits are a real pain, and pretty much limit campaigning to local elections (deposit-less) or the odd MP election (the Party is standing in a by-election caused by one MP resigning to stand for the regional PCC). Do they keep ordinary (non-super rich) people out of national politics? Sure. Do they keep crazy people out? No, only badly-funded crazy people. They're just one of the many barriers to a multi-party political system in England and Wales (including FPTP elections).

As for the actual PCCs, I haven't read up on them much (the elections are probably going to be a disaster as no one really cares about them), but the idea of politicising the police sounds pretty terrible. There was a big stir recently after it was announced that Magistrates (voluntary, ""lay"" judges in the lowest criminal courts) couldn't also stand; England already has a huge problem with lay magistrates being ... well, the sort of people who want to play judge, with all the prejudices that go with that, and I hate to think what will happen if those sorts of people end up with power over policing...",DukePPUk,1349563525.0,Sun Oct  7 00:45:25 2012,3.0,mod,114934,0,3079.0,0.0

I think you are a great watercolourist (Idk if there is a better term) and I enjoy seeing your work around reddit, although I feel like I haven't seen you around lately. 

Let me start off me saying I'm a little drunk right now and it kind of blew my mind to see that you were the one posting a challenge in this sub. 

As others have said, I think the earlier paintings are more true to your name ""shitty"". Not that they are bad, but that they look like you literally grabbed your water colours and took a picture of the painting. Even though most of us do not possess a fraction of the skill it took to make such paintings, they were more relatable. 

Your newer paintings are great. You have obviously mastered your craft and your paintings are far from shitty. They are also much better than anything the average person could create. Your newer paintings, even though they are water color, don't look like what we expect a water color painting to look like. The detail is much too fine and it would be impossible for me to make such a thing. 

I don't know how to continue from there because, like I said before, I am drunk. Have a goodnight/good day. Keep making water color and progress in your career however you see fit. ",None,1414311207.0,Sun Oct 26 09:13:27 2014,4.0,none,"2,409,827",1,,
1765,"There have been a few studies being published recently that backup what Dr Robert Sapolsky says about stress in his book Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers:

Stress shuts down the preforntal cortex which involved in higher reasoning and control over base impulses
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=this-is-your-brain-in-meltdown

Now immunologists at the University of Birmingham have found that increased stress levels and depression brought on by grief can interfere with the function of a type of white blood cell known as neutrophils, which are responsible for fighting bacterial infections like pneumonia.
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9164466/Grief-leaves-the-body-at-risk-of-infection.html

The participants' levels of cytokines, like interleukin-6 (ILK-6), rose after stressful negative events, often arguments or competitive social interactions. They were not elevated after competitive sports games, suggesting that sports may involve a friendlier form of competition, while competitive social interactions are experienced as negative events.

1768,">It seems sufficiently clear that the author is referring to the general conception of capitalism, i.e. a system of social relations and trade, based on private property and free markets.

If the author would actually be talking about the free market then this would not be an issue. But is the market free when governments around the world help some corporations more than the others? Free market doesn't mean private property. Free market is an establishment where some aren't favored more by laws made by corrupted politicians. Those who advocate a free market usually understand that natural monopoly theory is a myth and monopolies would have a much harder time to form than in today's society. So why all the monopoly? Couldn't regulation of the free market by the state have something to do with this? Or everything?

>No. A cursory glance at the temporal order makes that sufficiently clear.

Of course, we shouldn't really be looking to deep into these matters. Lets just pick someone to blame and everyone will be happy! Please find another sub reddit where people don't bother thinking a lot.

The first had been the revolt of the nobility, refusing to aid King Louis XVI through the payment of taxes.[1] The second had been the formation of the National Assembly and the Tennis Court Oath.

The middle class had formed the National Guard, sporting tricolor cockades (rosettes) of blue, white and red, formed by combining the red-and-blue cockade of the Paris commune and the white cockade of the king. These cockades, and soon simply their color scheme, became the symbol of the revolution and, later, of France itself.

Paris, close to insurrection, and, in François Mignet's words, ""intoxicated with liberty and enthusiasm,""[2] showed wide support for the Assembly. The press published the Assembly's debates; political debate spread beyond the Assembly itself into the public squares and halls of the capital. The Palais-Royal and its grounds became the site of an endless meeting. The crowd, on the authority of the meeting at the Palais-Royal, broke open the prisons of the Abbaye to release some grenadiers of the French guards, reportedly imprisoned for refusing to fire on the people. The Assembly recommended the imprisoned guardsmen to the clemency of the king; they returned to prison, and received pardon.

Could this subreddit do review threads for newly released games? I've submitted reviews for new games, only to have somebody yell at me saying it's not ""news"". Which I disagree with.

Comments are fine for the most part aside from some articles getting circlejerked in both directions, but what can ya do?

1877,"So one day I was wearing shoes, and they were pretty comfortable. I decided they were good to walk in, so I walked in them. That wasn’t so bad, so I kept doing it for the rest of the day.

Over the next four days, my shoes got more and more comfortable, and I wondered if it would continue. I asked another person about this, and they said “No—your pair’s just being broken in. It starts off stiff but then adapts to your foot shape.”

I thought that was pretty cool. But it wouldn’t last forever, as the person said. So then I realized that the shoes would go on, but they would begin to stay the same. I wondered how I could change that.

When I got home, I googled “Things to do with shoes” so I would know how to spice it up with them. Turns out, you can tie shoelaces! I had just been using tape to keep my shoes closed around my feet. I took the tape off, and pulled off the shoes; then, I realized that they were Velcro.

I googled “What to do with Velcro shoes” but didn’t get many answers. Unfortunately, I had shoes that I couldn’t do much with. I couldn’t try out crazy knots or anything, or whip people with long laces. But! There was one thing that I wanted to try out.

When I got to a crowded place the next day, I remembered what I had decided: I would practice first. Immediately, I bent down and started applying and un-applying the straps, making some noise. People began to walk around me in a circle.

It worked!

Over the next few months, I made noise with my shoes, mastering the art of moving a crowd and making noise with Velcro.

I was ready, now. This was a pretty cool thing to do with Velcro shoes, I had to admit.

I went up to Times Square, five pairs of shoes in each hand; having mastered the art of telekinetically moving their Velcro straps, I had the power of the ancients in my hands. I threw them into their positions, and with rhythmic Velcro-snapping, I summoned it. The Lace, the Strap. The Shoe-closer.

It beckoned to me, as the people in the streets ran. It asked what I had summoned it for.

With sheer courage keeping me going, I said two words: “Louder Velcro.” The Shoe-closer nodded, and left. I knew it had fulfilled my request.

After I was no longer on national television, I made my way to a crowded street. I bent over, looking at my shoes. I knew what I wanted to do.

I ripped the strap, making a 100 dB noise, exploding all cars arounding and permanently deafening myself. I grinned.

It was time to put these shoes to good use.",CummyBot2000,1558889920.0,Sun May 26 18:58:40 2019,1.0,mod,1951,0,1.0,0.0

For me, this is such a huge thing. I've been hating on Walmart for years because of how poorly they treat their suppliers. To see Sony change and embrace that feels like such a good thing for the health of the gaming economy.

I think about the cost that had been charged for patches along side the amount of money an indy would make. I heard $40,000 for a patch. If an Indy is selling their game for $10 and let's say their cut is $7.50, they would need to sell over 5,000 copies of the game just to pay for the patch. And that doesn't include what it costs the companies to pay the employees to write the patch.

2051,"I have a cursory experience with audio production on PC,
My current understanding of the Android pro audio market is:

Lack of proper low-latency APIs (real time scheduling and exclusive small buffer access to soundcard).

Default linux provides both these things (which jackd uses fine on my system down to 1.5ms, but how you use them (without root) on Android is unknown to me)

Poor UI latency issues, including:

* [Touch screen latency](http://www.imore.com/iphone-5-touchscreen-latency-measured-found-be-25-times-faster-closest-android-device)

* [Java is required for UI, and sound(?)](https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/index.html) (proper real time requires you to count the amount of nanoseconds your code takes to run, C/C++ can output to ASM, allowing you to reason about performance properly)

* is turning off Vsync and triple buffering possible?

Some of these things also effect gaming, for example I bet my Super Hexagon record on my first run through on PC, input latency is a huge issue!

Other things that might be a consideration is that iPhone's CPUs are clocked lower (1.4GHz), [but perform similarly to a 2.5GHz Krait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megahertz_myth), probably increasing battery life on CPU intensive tasks or at least reduce CPU throttling and other things like CPU governors interfering with performance.",YellowOnion,1436236132.0,Tue Jul  7 04:28:52 2015,38.0,mod,"419,772",1,719.0,0.0

It's not exactly trivial to just remake garageband from scratch as an indie dev. It's like asking for someone to just make a facebook or photoshop clone. It just doesn't happen.

2115,"Okay, well I'll still take that as opinion, and a possibly outdated one - typical gender roles are breaking down a bit and women are working similar jobs to men and still having children.  I don't think the difference in suicide rates is due to ""more"" stress.  I think men and women deal with stress differently - and it may well be a cause of disease in men, but I think it's a bit presumptuous to say men just have more stress than women.  What makes you think women have any more balance in their lives?

It'd be an interesting study to see - how gender differences influence inflammation-causing stress/disease - but until it's done I don't think we can draw conclusions, especially with just anecdotal evidence or guessing that women just have less going on and get less stressed.

2138,"I agree with you. The Objectivist leaning people I know, including my radiologist brother, are focused on gathering wealth, increasing individual freedom and accountability, are not interested in having children, and tend to have the lifeboat mentality. I'm not saying this is all wrong, but it appears to me that it's only viable for a small subset of humanity. 

In fact, Rand was almost an archetype of this personality. She chose not to have children or do other things which limited her freedom. That's fine, except that if everyone felt like she did, we'd be rapidly depopulating the earth and children who were born couldn't expect much of an upbringing. The author of the article here - http://rationaljenn.blogspot.com/2009/09/mythbusting-ayn-rand-mommies-and.html - comically goes out of her way to describe her children as a joint venture and her stay at home motherhood as a voluntary career choice. What the heck is wrong with such people?

Another trait I see in objectivist leaning people is that they seem to believe deep down that they pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, all the way from infancy to their current position, that no one but them was critical in helping them get to where they are now and that any help they did receive was part of a rational exchange of benefits. This is such a comically nonsensical belief I don't know where to begin. 

Finally, objectivism is almost solipsistic in its lack of consideration of the world outside, how we are part of the universe of life, dependent on those who came before us and (hopefully) contributing something for those who will come after us.

Anyway, objectivism is not a serious philosophy. It's more of a formal system that tries to justify selfishness with philosophical-sounding arguments. I've tried to outline a few reasons why.",crlamke,1315414808.0,Wed Sep  7 19:00:08 2011,1.0,no mod,413070,0,692.0,0.0

Who would have guessed that one group of humans would tend to behave the same as other humans?

People enjoy rules.  People enjoy structure! Hell, why do you think sports have so many God damned rules? It's no wonder that people enjoy some laws and organization! 

And yes of course the government manipulates their people.  The government is much more aware of social tendencies than the general public, and can easily manipulate them.  Do you know how easy it is to manipulate someone who trusts you?  You could easily manipulate your best friend unless they are constantly paranoid around you.  That's why conspiracy theorists exist!  These people don't trust their government and question nearly everything they say.

Sure, many conspiracies have turned out to be true, but this is only because many more conspiracies have turned out to be false!  People believe what they trust, and if people don't believe their government then then they won't believe what the government says.  In a sense everything the government says/does can or will be questioned, so whenever the government lies to it's people this can become a conspiracy.  

Don't consider it slavery, just accept it as the government abusing the trust of its people.  In some cases I bet the government can justify lying to its people, and many people in this subreddit will disagree with that right.",Cerael,1333599260.0,Thu Apr  5 06:14:20 2012,1.0,no mod,32087,0,1366.0,1.0

You can calibrate the position of the holo-keyboard relative to your character and its compass direction relative to your chair so it matches the height of your desk and how far back your chair is.

2327,"Ex-Arcade worker here.

There is actually a technique to win these sort of games. I thought the dude with the lego man hair was going to go into it, but he didn't. So I will instead.

This technique works for the grabber craw machines but I guess the same principles can be applied to the stacker game. But you need a lot of time and patience if you want to win. I used to work in an arcade at Alton Towers in England and was told how the claw game works. The guy in this video discusses what most arcade attendants and technicians know. These games are 'fixed' and require a certain number of plays before they release a prize.

I will stick to talking about the claw game as it's what I am most familiar with, but like I said, I can't see why this wouldn't work for the stacker game. 

The claw would grab more firmly after 100 plays at Alton Towers, but depending on how busy the theme park was, we adjusted the number accordingly. On busier days we would increase it to 200. For the sake of this discussion, we'll stick with 100. So assuming on that 100th try you made a pretty accurate attempt to grab something, the claw would grab your prize because it is set to grab more firmly after 100 plays. Here's where the time and patience comes in.

You have to keep an eye on the claw game until a player makes a successful grab and wins a prize. The machines counter is reset back to zero. You now have to watch the game and keep a count of how many plays that particular machine has had. See where I'm going with this?
Keep on counting plays until the machine finally releases another prize. Now you know how many plays the game needs before the crane game will make a real attempt to grip a prize. Your count should be 100 (more on less depending on how often the machine is set to make a 'real' grab attempt. But because you have counted, you know the number required)

You now have to watch the game and keep another tally of how many plays that game has had. This will obviously take awhile, but it's less time consuming on busier days. You can even watch multiple games at one time. Once the game has been played about 95 times, make sure you are the next person to use that machine. This can be risky if the last person to play does not leave the machine.

Now that you're on the machine, we know the game has been played 95  times since the last 'payout'. All you have to do now is play the game a couple of times and you should grab a nice new teddy bear. Just make sure you go for an easy grab, otherwise you might screw up and you will be back to square one.

I'm pretty sure that somebody with enough time on their hands could do the same thing with the stacker game and walk away with some pretty nice prizes.",Tidus5005,1347141183.0,Sat Sep  8 23:53:03 2012,6.0,mod,"419,772",1,52200.0,0.0

>Why now?
>Nearly one billion people go to bed hungry every night and two million children die from malnutrition every year. We've made progress in other areas, but hunger is still the great scandal of our age. All around the world, even in the UK, people are struggling to feed their families.

>In 2013, the government has promised to provide 0.7% of national income for aid and to host a Hunger Summit. We must make sure they keep these promises. In June, the world’s most powerful leaders will meet in the UK at the G8.

>This is our best opportunity to tackle hunger. We must make IF happen.

 

>What’s happening in 2013?
You can find a timeline of the key moments in the Enough Food For Everyone IF campaign in our Get Involved section.

 

>What do we want?
We want our leaders to act on the four big issues that mean so many people do not get enough food. 

>Aid

>Enough Food For Everyone IF we give enough aid to stop children dying from hunger and help the poorest families feed themselves.

>Tax

>Enough Food For Everyone IF governments stop big companies dodging tax in poor countries.

>Land

>Enough Food For Everyone IF we stop poor farmers being forced off their land and grow crops to feed people, not fuel cars.

>Transparency

>Enough Food For Everyone IF governments and big companies are honest and open about their actions that stop people getting enough food.

>Together, we can make IF happen.

>The more of us who get involved, then the greater pressure there will be on world leaders to tackle global hunger in 2013.

One distinction is decentralization; for example, the left opposition within the Soviet Union opposed the centralized power wielded from the Kremlin and Party leadership, and instead wanted the Soviets that were organized in every region and workplace to be in charge (the constitution set up a ""union of Soviets"" officially, but they were quickly sidelined in practice). The claim is that at some level of decentralization, groups of people who know each other are collectively ruling themselves, rather than instituting a bureaucratic state, with a ruling elite, to rule them.

The debate over ""direct democracy"" is related. I see these kinds of collective-local-decision-making views as having a lot in common with advocates of small-scale direct democracy, except that they disagree over things like property rights.",_delirium,1315245995.0,Mon Sep  5 20:06:35 2011,2.0,no mod,413070,0,3795.0,0.0

People break the law *now*, imagine if there was no police force and no laws (no law breaking, but you understand what I'm getting at). Nothing to stop criminals at all. We all saw the images from hurricane katrina, (and other catastrophes), police are gone for five minutes and immediately looting starts. Rioting and looting happens everywhere, it's always the police who stop it. Always. I envision at this point you're saying ""**BUT RIOTS AND LOOTING ARE CAUSED BY INEQUALITY**"". What about france? Where it was race.
  
Infact, in communism, since 'the economic playing field' needs levelling so everyone earns the same wage, criminals could earn masses of money, making it so that they have a very attractive lifestyle (a problem today, see: rap music). Continuing with the 'crime does actually pay' idea, organised crime would probably form some sort of a state, in fact, I imagine any anarchic society would immediately fall victim to an organised force of criminals. Since, due to their amoral criminal nature they are violent and ruthless, not to mention the fact that organised forces always beat disorganised forces (see Romans vs. Barbarians).

2532,"It was actually when they were starving to death and had insane inflation and everything was in tatters that they tried to take over the world, they most certainly were NOT prosperous.  Their extreme poverty is what enabled the Nazis to gain so much support.  They told everyone that they were actually kickass awesome people and that they were being persecuted, and that they could easily be the best country in the world if they just had some discipline and worked to better society.

>At the Constitutional Convention, it was warned that an ""excess of democracy"" (direct quote!) must be avoided.

Of course it was.  You think ""mob rule"" is a good thing?  Or do you think that the nation would have voluntarily given up slavery and such things?  An 'excess of democracy' leads to the persecution of minorities as scapegoats.

Appealing to 'the founders said it so it's right' is definitely falatious.  Quoting the founders, however, is generally a good idea because many of their ideas were correct.  And they remain correct today, as few of them had any basis in specific circumstances.  And even in the couple hundred years between them and us, most of the things they stood for have only been proven as more solidly true.  Slavish adherence to a Consitution is only bad in exactly as far as the Consitition is based upon untrue ideas.  Slavish devotion will never turn ideas like equal protection under the law to all people bad.  If there is a problem with some part of it, we've got the reason and usually enough historical evidence to show it pretty easily, without having to resort to any mystical pleas like 'the Constitution says it, therefore it must be so' or 'the Constitution says it, and is old, so therefore it must not be so'.",otakucode,1327512475.0,Wed Jan 25 18:27:55 2012,2.0,mod,413070,0,415.0,0.0

So I went to youporn.com to find out (strictly for science!!). Youporn serves videos from a cdn distribution (cdn1.static.youporn.phncdn.com) And the cdn edge servers are lighttpd serving video files. 

Interestingly, pornhub and keezmovies also use the same cdn provider, but I couldn't find more details about who runs phncdn.com &#3232;\_&#3232;

>The other thing is that YouPorn's Redis cluster handles 300k queries per second -- but only has 4000 PVs per second at peak time. I figured that big excess of queries could be explained by storing video in Redis.

2680,"I know people are in a downvote brigade but they really need to think about how much hate they give people and their situations. For credibility I'll tell something I've told nobody in my life. I was molested when I was ten but in the end mentally I made it out a better person. When I was a hormonal teenager I came very close to molesting a very young boy for reasons I don't understand. I still live with terrible regret for even thinking about doing that but I can see given the right circumstances I probably would have done it.

 I have no attraction to men or kids but the situation itself and the feeling of power must be what I instinctively tried to follow through with. Seriously sickens me thinking about that part of my life. Just to let people know I have brothers and a much younger sister and have never had the desire or even casually thought of doing anything like that since that point in my life. Can't even imagine how I'd be had I followed through with my initial fucked up curiosity. I am happy to be past all of that but it doesn't stop the immense guilt I feel from ALMOST doing it. 

It's very likely that this guy went through the exact situation the boy he was abusing did. Probably for longer and without justice being served. If you use a little empathy you can see the boy could have easily become the same person as his abuser. 

I am not defending his actions just that he's probably already had to go through worse than what that boy did, grow up with fucked up feelings and desires, get the shit beaten out of him for stupidly following through with those desires, and now he goes to prison for 25 years where he gets raped even more. 

It's not that he doesn't deserve punishment, just maybe rehabilitation as opposed to even more rape would be better? I don't think him getting raped is justice. After 25 years I think he'll be so fucked in the head he'll probably want to rape more than ever.

I know I assumed a lot but most abusers were abused themselves and never saw justice to their original abuser. It creates a complex in people that needs to be studied and used to rehabilitate future abusers.

He could just be evil and a pedophile but I doubt it's that black and white, especially given his age. You can hate him and want justice served but it really is blind justice to find joy in him being raped in prison. I think the beating was justified, he just doesn't need to be raped any more. You don't fix rapists by raping them. Rape just leads to more rape and shouldn't be cheered or wished on people. 

If he has a conscience he probably feels more regret than you can possibly imagine.",shmerk-a-berl,1428346930.0,Mon Apr  6 21:02:10 2015,10.0,no mod,"1,398,796",1,361.0,0.0

Anyway my question is to the programmers: As a Java developer myself I have often thought about picking up a C based language and having a stab at making some basic little platformer with  badly drawn sprites just to see how it's done.

2747,"* **Response Times are slow, regardless of what you say.**

You have very friendly employees that work for you guys and phone support is great.  You guys had your hours wrong on your website, you guys don't tailor any support structure for Americans, and email support can only give you one **canned** response per day.  I've timed it once, 22 hours to respond to an email.

* **You are completely inflexible and only allow 1.2 gigs of memory to host a server of 150 people**

I spent a lot of money and worked very hard to have the best and top server on the market.  Every night we had 145+ on the server.  However, server stability died 24 hours after a wipe, and we were getting constant server restarts.  Every time our server went above 1.6 gigs, you restarted the server.  Come to find out you guys only give 1.2 gigs of memory out for a 150 gig server.  You told us it was a memory leak, however, what you failed to mention was that the leak wasn't technically a leak.  The game just never released memory, so it was always at peak, so if your Rust server was at 1.7 gigs RAM peak, it was going to stay like that forever.  The game never ingested more RAM without a warrant for it.  So we asked for more RAM.   You guys said no.  We asked to buy two servers.  You guys said no.  We asked if there was anything we can do.  ""Pay us 200$ and we'll get you a VPS with 2 gigs of RAM.""

In summary, I spent tons of effort and cash to build a great server that topped the lists. I CHOSE TO KEEP YOUR BRANDING ON TO PROMOTE YOU, and you guys wasted my money and now I have no server because the server I obtained from you guys had no mention on how cheap you guys are about memory.  I was stuck with you guys, and you guys gave me the cold shoulder and told me to go fuck myself unless I emptied my wallet on your desk.  And since the server rebooted every 15 minutes because of your automatic RAM laws, i couldn't resolve the issue.  Even WIPING the server didn't fix it, 6 hours later, it was rebooting ever 15 minutes again.  Everyone quit, because who wants to play on a server starved for memory?  I had something really good going and you fucked me.  Hard.  Because you couldn't give two shits if your customers were really in need and TRYING to throw money at you. (And no, no one in their right mind would spend 200$ for 2gigs of fucking ram.)",kelosane,1393874019.0,Mon Mar  3 20:13:39 2014,2.0,mod,114934,0,4210.0,0.0

2.) **Less spin in titles** - Gaming like any other people/fan driven thing tends to have many people who are caught up in the heat of the times. Unfortunately, this tends to trickle down to even this subreddit where titles are created with a certain agenda in mind, or perhaps certain sites are linked to that present the news in a biased way.

2754,"I honestly don't understand why it is so hard for these companies to understand their customers.  This is a bullshit e-mail.  ""We don't have a stance but our parent company is against it, and we're not going to disagree because we agree on many other, less significant issues.""  Yeah fuck you, too.

At the same time I wonder what it is about most of Reddit in that we continue to post these things but then the comments are flooded with ""But I'm so tempted...""
The last game I bought NEW was Skyrim, and before that it was Catherine and Halo:Reach.  I don't have anything else.  I used to sell games for a living and I've played my fair share, but it's really not that hard to just not buy them.  Like, BF3 looks amazing to me, but I'm totally cool with not dropping the cash on it.  I'm totally cool with that, and seeing this message from EA *definitely* doesn't change my opinion on that.  If anything, I'm more cool with it.

Reddit has thousands of members.  This subreddit alone claims ""1,042,483"" as of 4:55am EST on January 17, 2012.  Discounting dead/novelty/dual accounts, that's still a fair amount of people, and that's just one subreddit.  If the gaming industry lost a million players or more, I'm sure they'd feel it somewhere down the line.  The priorities here seem to be ""Well I'm totally against SOPA and hate the living fuck out of any company or organization that supports it, but their products are so shiny and pretty that I'll buy them anyway and just feel guilty.""
So basically you're saying you'll indulge in this guilty pleasure now instead of resisting temptation for the sake of the greater good.  It's not really a matter of what is the ""lesser of two evils"" here so I don't really get it.

Outside of Reddit, I've met a bunch of people who have heard of SOPA, but none that have heard of PIPA, another batshit idea.  The last I checked with her, not even my mom knew about SOPA but had heard somewhere about PIPA.  I think that Reddit can make a huge impact on this kind of stuff, but it doesn't come easy.

Now, after a year of preparing myself (and after getting to experience all the swipe gestures on my iPad), I figured I was ready for a new phone interface. So, I got myself the iPhone XS.

It all started on that fateful day when my best friend Kendall created the Facebook event that millions would join. An event to spend a lifetime telling stories about. The raid on Area 51. In the early days I was naive, acting like the whole thing was a joke. Then the unthinkable happened.

When I was walking home from school. I noticed an odd can of monster on the sidewalk. Monster, of course, is my favorite drink. But this one was different. I had never seen one like it. The beautiful metallic sheen. The radioactive signs all over it. The flavor, atomic yellow. I knew I had to experience it for myself. I popped it open and the best smell I’ve ever experienced came rushing at me. It was like heaven, but monster flavored. I chugged the whole thing in less than a second, but I felt something. The liquid inside me felt like it was burning my throat. It hurt so bad I collapsed onto the ground. 

The next morning I woke up somehow in my bed. I remembered nothing after the monster. I got up, and felt stronger. I looked in the mirror and noticed how perfect my muscles were. At first I thought it was from all the punching through drywall I did, but this was even better. Just to test my new abilities, I tried flicking a pencil. The pencil shot through the air and went straight through my wall. I still don’t know where it went. I decided I needed to go to school and did my homework on the way. Somehow I completed it all in less than a minute, 5 pages of math problems. I knew the monster had changed me. Finally, I got to school.

The first thing I did was find Kendall and tell him we needed to skip school. He didn’t need an excuse, he just walked right out with me. I explained everything to him, the monster, the pencil, the math I told him everything. He told me we had to find out where it was from. After talking about what the can looked like, we decided on Area 51. We decided to book a flight there and get there on September 19th, the day before the raid, to find some answers. 

Fast forward to September 19th. We arrive with the rest of the raiders. I immediately asserted dominance over the rest of the group by through out monsters into the crowd and shouting like a monkey. They immediately gave me leadership and started calling me general Kyle. As we found our hotels we knew had to prepare. With my extreme IQ and perfect muscles all I needed to sustain myself for battle was a 24 pack of monsters. I practiced the whole night by punching holes in the hotels drywall. Finally, I went to sleep, and September 20th arrived.

2999,"The three (3) reasons why I rented a Multiplay server and imediately canceled after the initial month.

1) You cannot edit the LUA files of mods with Multiplay and basically have zero freedom with adjusting mods with their service.

This is huge for me as I am in the process of developing mods for games. Not being able to adjust the mod to serve my needs is a huge turndown.

2) Support. I may have put in 4 to 5 support tickets and had to wait a whole day to have them answered with the most minimal effort possible which basically comes down to no solution at all, even while support stating they resolved the issue. One issue was regarding a mod which took four (4) back and forth exchanges to finally tell me I couldn't edit the LUA file to get the mod to work with Oxmin. So why have the mod available?

3) Branding. $5 a month to have the freedom to change the name to my server to what I want? No thank you.

One more thing but it is not a big issue. You don't provide a currency exchange. I live in America and I have to convert the British Pounds to USD.

With the GSP I am with now I pay $19.95 for full access to freely change my mods, no support issues yet so I can't judge that and zero branding.

3031,"I'll try to get some mobile AA videos of tips I use.  Some pointers I can provide in text:

* If you're starting out and need to get unlocks, try to use the LAV-AD (US) over the Tunguska (RU) just because it's easier to use.

* Play smart; a mid- to close-range 1v1 with any other armor is a bad idea.  Don't sit in base, but don't advance too far beyond the area that your team controls.

* Move around; if you're in an effective area then good pilots will prioritize taking you out, and staying in one spot will make it easy for them to hit at distance.  Try to maintain visual on the attack heli and time your movement to avoid TV missiles.

* Pal up with pilots on your team if possible; if you're in the same squad then it will be easier for the pilots to spot you when they're in trouble.

* Judging how to lead moving aircraft takes practice.  When I started, I would use pulse bursts until I got hit markers and then I would have a good idea how much to lead by.  Anticipate helicopters dropping quickly to *below radar* and jets breaking away.

Learn how to use your missiles: 

* If you see an aircraft use countermeasures and you have missiles loaded, lock them and launch as soon as possible.  

* Use missiles to find out what countermeasures are being used by your opposition.

* Know that flares will not break your lock; you can fire 1 missile to force flares and if you wait the right amount of time while maintaining a lock, you can launch your second missile for damage. 

* Launch missiles even if you know you're going to miss on account of countermeasures, because you can distract a pilot from hitting their target and it can also help some AA infantry get a kill elsewhere.",commiecat,1364500743.0,Thu Mar 28 20:59:03 2013,2.0,mod,114934,0,2238.0,1.0

3040,"WZ is my favorite, was my first, and is also their most varied and longest album (beating BtC by almost ten minutes and S&E by almost 20), so, no question, it would be my desert island album. It fairly diisliked when it came out, apparently, but it's to date the only Pavement album cool enough to warrant a 33 1/3rd book ;)

I put S&E and CR,CR just behind WZ, because they're both absolute classics, and if I could take any *extended* edition on this desert island, it would be S&E: Luxe & Reduxe.

As to BtC... Check out the 1996 Cat's Cradle show (you can find it [here](https://doomandgloomfromthetomb.tumblr.com/post/149749842542/pavement-the-cats-cradle-chapel-hill-north)) where they previewed a pretty healthy amount of the upcoming BtC songs, although lyrically pretty unfinished. That bootleg had me excited for BtC, but I'm pretty sure that's why BtC sounds a bit too slick compared to controlled chaos that preceded it: they actually practiced these songs quite a bit before recording.

3108,"Thankfully, Rockstar did foresee the shortcomings of their text messaging system. They also included another method of communicating with other players that is infinitely complex, totally hands-free and has zero learning curve. All you have to do to access it, is open up the box that your Xbox 360 came with, take out the microphone that was *included with every fucking console*, and put it on your head. Once it's plugged in to the controller, you'll be able to speak with fellow players, who will be completely appreciative that you've joined the 21st century and can finally start contributing as a team member. No longer will players have to wonder whether or not you'll shoot them first, because you can talk to them before you get to them, and no longer will you die because you tried to give a ride to the wrong guy, because you can ask people what they're up to before you run up on them out of nowhere!

I gotta say, guys. I've been using this method of communicating since the first xbox came out, and it's perfect. Back then, everyone used it, but it dwindled over time, and it's really been the downfall of competitive console gaming. There's no other way to send information that fast.

I will end by saying, though, that for people who are deaf, or can't speak, this would be a great feature. I'd reccommend having a few common templates in a quick list, like ""Help,"" ""Yes,"" ""No,"" ""Follow me,"" etc., and then you could have probably a hundred different macros for more specific things,that you could send, like ""[msg53]"" would turn into a text message that says ""I'm not hostile, I'm coming in.""

3114,">If we get to ICBMs, we probably don't have to worry about tactics any longer. As soon as any country detects a wartime ICBM, they are assuming full out nuclear war.

Nuclear war strategies are not as simple as you assume. There is many stages of escalation. For example US provides nuclear umbrella for Japan using only nuclear weapons outside US soil (subs launching Tomahawks with nukes, now they are chancing to something else). They would not ever launch ICBM's from subs.  US is not going to start global thermonuclear war over Japan or Taiwan. 

If China uses tactical nukes against US Navy that are launched from Chinese chips or submarines, US will not escalate by launching ICBM's to Chinese soil. They might use tactical nukes against Chinese navy or military bases outside China (Burma for example) but not against Chinese territories unless China would do so first.  There could be limited nuclear war between Navies without it escalating. 

ICBM's are traditionally for maintaining threat of mutual destruction. Now it seems that US and other countries are ready to use them also in limited conflicts where escalation is determined by the place they are launched from and their targets.

3116,"Payments in Germany and many/most other European countries work very differently from what is common in the US. Almost 20 years ago, my aunt wrote me a check for the explicit purpose of me getting a chance to cash in a check at least once in my lifetime. She was right, I never got another and have never written one myself. Paying for groceries by check is something I can barely remember my parents doing when I was a child.

Small payments in the order of a few euros are typically made in cash, above a personal threshold people switch to electronic payments with a debit card, and the money gets transferred from the cash account a few days later. Regular static payments (e.g., rent, insurance) are typically set up to be transferred automatically via direct transfer, for variable bills (e.g., telephone) you give service providers an authorization to withdraw the amount directly from your cash account. This works, because consumer protection is very good. Most people use credit cards almost exclusively for online payments.  
So, when you check the balance of your cash account, you know pretty well where you stand, because that's where all payments show up.",CountVonTroll,1327523428.0,Wed Jan 25 21:30:28 2012,4.0,mod,413070,0,5879.0,0.0

3138,"Once I parked my ATV in park with the motor running. This was a shit ATV called the Yamaha Breeze for beginners. Apparently the Yamaha Breeze did not like to stay parked.

As I walked away from the Breeze I could hear its engine revving - and getting louder. I turned back to see the Breeze begin to creep forward. Slowly at first but picking up speed. 

As the Breeze rolled away I looked along its path to see where it was pointed. And sitting in its path was my father's brand new 1999 Chevrolet Corvette with soft top convertible. Black, shining and practically asking to be hit. 

There wasn't time but to shout ""fuck!"" as I leaped off the stairs away from my house - back toward the Breeze that was racing away in its limp effort to get me into all sorts of trouble.

I dashed across the driveway following its path as the Breeze bared down on the Corvette. Gaining ground on it, but the piece of shit continued to increase speed as it closed the gap to its prize.

As I reached toward it and grabbed its handle the Breeze fought me to break free. It slowed and pulled me forward off my feet but I gripped the handbrake and it stopped short with a a thunk!

His videos of ""owning the libs"" are popular on youtube, and they usually have titles like [these](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ben+shapiro+destroys)


He is hated by the far right because they believe his act of being a conservative is just a dumb charade, and he is a typical, run-of-the-mill neo-con that puts the interest of Israel above those of the US, and that he's Jewish doesn't help. The fact that he isn't extreme far-right and isn't overtly racist like some other alt-right figures also is a point of derision.

So, now they've started parodying him and his fanbase by making up absurd titles like [this](https://i.redd.it/is8ghu0t08a11.jpg).",ricoue,1536144259.0,Wed Sep  5 12:44:19 2018,56.0,mod,7091,0,24281.0,0.0

3183,"another reason there was so much time between patches is that DICE had to make and test different builds each time they made a change and that building (meaning incorporate all assets into the executive program you get in your computer) was a long and buggy process as they had to check that it didn't bring out more bugs that it fixed.

I think the 40000$ fee is less an obstacle that the internal cost in time and man power.

If the fee was the only problem, they would have patched the PC more regularly (no fee) but if, as they said, internal testing was the real issue : it made sense so patch less often in order to be sure they didn't break the game and have to release an emergency patch that would have lead to another emergency patch, costing them a lot of money.

Still, it was clearly sub-optimal and i hope the fact that they have a better handling of their engine now will mean it would be less trouble for them to patch the game.",None,1371722084.0,Thu Jun 20 11:54:44 2013,1.0,none,114934,0,,

3237,"I agree that the game should put more emphasis on score:death than kill:death. However, I don't think we need to worry too much about this :). 

First of all, as the game stands right now, capturing territories and bases (the main objective of the game) is the most rewarding thing a player can do for both him/herself as well as for the faction. It rewards with resources, xp, a bigger foothold on the continent, etc. I find it really hard to see a player in this game torn between securing an objective and keeping a kill streak. Doing the objectives is always going to be the most rewarding thing any player can do.

Secondly, kill streaks do encourage a player to be a bit smarter. In arena games, like you said, kills are the end goal or they provide boosts to the team like air strikes. In *those* games, kill streaks are the route to victory. In *this* game, that is not the case. Only the newest of noobies will fail to realize that, and I can guarantee their empires will be down their throats real fast.

TL;DR: Don't worry! :) Just because this game has a kill streak mechanism doesn't mean the players are going to think planetside is an arena game. Securing objectives is, and will continue to be, the most rewarding thing a player can do.",None,1331190499.0,Thu Mar  8 08:08:19 2012,2.0,none,114934,0,,

3312,"I was part of [the 1 percent](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/12/30/planetside-the-1-2/).

In all honesty I've never played a game with moments more epic than planetside. Battlefield moments just don't compare. Like this one:

Our outfit platoon was on Searhus, inside the crater. Normally we would move around the continent in 5 full Galaxies towards our target but today that wasn't possible. Inside the crater their were Skyguards, Sparrows, and stupid amounts of infantry equipped with a Phoenix. A Sunderer wasn't an option since we had no tech lab, and Deliverers were out of the question since their was just as much AV as AA.

Instead we decided to load up inside Peles' lobby, all 50 of us. The call was for medics and engineers to bring as much juice as possible. Infantry was to use REXO suits,Cyclers, and Strykers only. MAX units were to be AV and AA only. The order was given to push towards Oro, and my most enjoyable moment began.

We pushed through to the lava fields under fire from the enemies aircraft. They didn't last long against 30 Strykers. Once we got to the lava fields the forces at Oro and Oro tower spotted us. On the bright side we had gotten to the boulders that cover the center of the crater so we had cover. We would push up to a different group of boulders, leapfrogging to medics and engineers who would then heal and repair us to keep our slow push moving. Every time anyone ducked out from behind cover to push forward yellow and blue tracers lit up the crater. We continued our slow push for about five minutes without losing a single soldier.

We got to the last set of boulders before having to cross the road to Oro tower, there would be nowhere to hide from the barrage of bullets on this final push. No one hesitated. Our ten MAX units engaged their auto-run to draw fire from the enemy forcing some to switch to AV weapons, big mistake. Immediately after, the forty infantry we had behind the rocks ready to run made their move. Cyclers drawn, we pushed to the tower to meet up with out MAX units who were now keeping the infantry inside the tower by guarding the ground floor doors. As we pushed our outfit leader, BuzzCutPsycho, was calling out targets that had to die. The second an enemy was called out for execution, they were dead. Instead of any of us dying from the push from the boulders to the tower, we had killed fifteen NC to the spawn screen and forced many more to fall back inside the tower.

When we got to the tower we had our engies and medics heal everyone up for the final push. Once again we sent our MAX units in first. AV, then AA, then infantry. The doors opened, and immediately we sent a squad of five to guard the spawn stairs so there would be no reinforcements. Our AV MAXs pushed up the stairs hard, killing 3 of the MAX units that had posted up a defense. Our infantry followed pushing hard and fast only stopping to reload while the ones behind them took over, pushing hard and fast. By the time the tower was ours we had accrued fifty unique kills and suffered three casualties. We set up in the spawn room to re-arm ourselves with MCGs and Strykers. Then we got into formation and ran outside, all fifty of us, all looking in the same direction, all with the same goal. Oro.

3375,"I also volunteer. As everyone else said I think that the main focus of moderating is deleting spam messages. I believe that the subreddit should moderate itself meaning that I am not going to enforce any rules that are rejected by the community and I am going to enforce even the ones I dont like if the community says it should be done that way. For example I have a big issue with racism and facism. I belive even talking about their actions, empowers them. However if the community believes that racism should be revealed to the public in order to weaken it, I will accept it. (I am not going to accept a racism-fasism oriented subreddit though and I will have to resign)

About me; I am 24 years old university student, meaning I have couple of time available. I participate in chat and forums since the age of 10 and I have moderated both chats and forums during all those years.

Look closer on the Neonode:
When you swipe from LEFT to RIGHT, you are signalling ""YES"". RIGHT to LEFT signals ""NO"". So when you swipe to right, it signals ""YES - bring up the screen"". Swipe left and it signals ""NO - close screen"".

iPhone's slide to unlock is a tad different, you can ""unlock"" the screen to open up the app drawer after **completing** a gesture on the lock screen. You need to drag the slider to 100% in order to unlock, if you drag it up to, say, 95% and release it, the slider will fall back to its original position and will not unlock the phone.

Again, to an average person they are both the same concept. But the patent office will need absolute technical specifications. That's why Apple's slide to unlock patent is granted.

EDIT Afterthoughts: Come to think of it, most android phones now have **swipe** to unlock. Meaning you do a swiping gesture on the screen to unlock it. There is no limit on how far or short you can swipe your phone. Both iOS and Android should have their respective patents - they are more different than you and I think.",fermilevel,1347342496.0,Tue Sep 11 07:48:16 2012,3.0,no mod,413070,0,648.0,0.0

McConnell is a sociopath and too cunning to do this for no gain. Something has to give here. Either the funds will be limited to specific things that are still under GOP control, or they'll be tied to an ultimately unpalatable bill where Democrats will be forced to sign on and give away more money or control to this administration, or he is certain they can sufficiently undermine elections enough for it not to matter, or a combination of the above.

* Firstly, and most importantly, it would improve the multiplayer experience for gamers on platforms that encourage easy patching i.e. the PS4 and PC
* Secondly, it would put pressure on Microsoft to remove the patch fees because they would lose customers when people realise they will have a better experience on the PS4 and PC

There's no reason to make everyone suffer because Microsoft chooses to enforce draconian requirements for software patches.

3662,"When I was in the US, having been to 26+ countries, I've never been so pissed of at a society... Like how the fuck can you keep building aircraft carriers, when the New York subway is like it is? 

And during my time there, visiting several cities (san fransisco, hollywood, las vegas, new york, pheonix, new orleans) I literally saw 3 godamn clocks at the airports/trainstations.

I'm sorry, I know I sound like a european snob and all that bullshit but jesus christ here in sweden even the godamn buss-stops have clocks, timetables and arrival times. 

Mexico has a better infrastructure for travel than the US has for crying out loud, as does eastern europe, north africa etc. 

Oh and don't get me started at American Airways, god that company would be sue'd to shit here in the EU because we don't let companies dictate how they should function and treat their own customers. 

Fucking ""Force majeure"" my arse, first they stopped my plane because it had break problems, then the FBI raided it because some idiot worded off with the staff, THEN a storm creeps in. But NOPE! It was totally the storms fault all that time, no refund, no housing, no food, not even a godamn blanket (Which another airway gave out later, with water and biscuits). I've slept on mud floors, in dirty hammocks and sleepingbags when it's -30c outside, but that was the first time I slept on the godamn floor of baggage-checkout with my shoes as pillow (because our baggage had already left). All in all I was delayed 28 hours on a airport with no recompensation. Tho I did get to stand in line to check in again and this time they fondled me.

Once in sweden I've had a flight delayed and cancelled, was treated to a hotel (bussed there) with a breakfest buffe to top it off. And it was force majeure as well. Heck in godamn Japan the CEO begs for forgiveness when there's delays and bows to the camera in respect to the people who missed weddings, fungerals etc.

Sorry for this rant but my point is, you feel fucking helpless in the US against companies... And I genuinely feel sad at the population having this horrid political system that puts up with it.

Heavy Rain, Assassin's Creed, Bulletstorm, Bayonetta, Borderlands, and many others. These are games from big companies, and I could easily make the case for them that they are ingenuitive and new.

I keep meaning to write to him via 'Snail Mail' and tell him how much of an impact he has had on my life and hopefully have the same impact on my kids when they work their way through his glorious bibliography.  But as always I never see it through.

however as i said this submission is not to talk about this. also it seems you have misinterpreted my words. i did not say i am going to ban everything facistic just because i am opponent to the ideology. i said i am going to ban everything facistic if the community decides so or allow everything facistic if the community decides so.

You could argue that this ban needed to be repealed, because some British people are vegetarians and are therefore at a much lower risk of having contracted vCJD. But the fact is that people who spent more than 3 months in Britain between 1980 and 1993 make up a small percentage of the population in most other countries and the act of allowing them to donate would increase the risk much more than increasing the blood supply.",ajudson,1315492940.0,Thu Sep  8 16:42:20 2011,13.0,no mod,413070,0,234.0,0.0

Since tools outside of RES exist, at least you have something to use in the meantime... 

In addition, if I'm not improving on what's already out there, then all I'm doing by rolling it into RES is ""taking it over"", which developers may not particularly be happy about...

And if they did, The manufacturer would listen so you could buy the next model. This is a 50.00 video game. A video game. Wait until a drug manufacturer makes something and a doctor prescribes something that gives your mother cancer to go in rage mode. Dice is people, they are a bunch of damn nerds like us.

3968,"On paper the ps4 is hardware wise more powerful than the xboner. That's a fact. However a really crucial part besides hardware is software optimization. Without proper software optimization the best hardware won't help. (I.e why do some emulators have low fps even though the hardware is dozen times better than the original console? Because it's not optimized well enough). I'm sure that the dev team from both companies are very capable. Rationally speaking, the Sony devs should be capable enough to make a software and kernel efficient enough to take full advantage of the ps4s hardware. If that is the case then of course it'll be more powerful than the xboner. Its nothing about being bias or a fan boy,  it's just how it is. We'll see how performance actually differs between console when the time comes, anyone down for any wagers? As a last point, my personal preference is towards the ps4. I simply didn't like Microsofts approach with the xbox360, it had huge hardware faults(don't need to elaborate more) and had a lot of things which I didn't agree with(monthly fees, requiring gold for accessing netflix etc). I owned both a 360 and ps3, sure the party chat was fun but I didn't really see real evidence that the online was so much better on the xbox. Sony being hacked could have happened to any company, no one can deny that either. For some reason people always have something to complain about or to fight on certain sides due to personal bias. If you want to buy a xboner, go for it. If you want a ps4 go for it. At the end of the day I'll enjoy the console I'm comfortable with.",None,1369531731.0,Sun May 26 03:28:51 2013,1.0,none,114934,0,,

Liberals should act better. But we can all agree in the end that *words don't offend people*, but *people with words offend people* right? 

I mean, it's not like she sent bombs to a bunch of prominent democratic figures, or shot up a mosque? 

We can at least all agree she's better-behaved then our president, which is fucking ironic as hell right now. Baby twittershit is this man's idol, and he can't take the same shit that his hero gives to dignified statesmen who have done so much more than him in any capacity. The irony is deep and sad. 

Redhats love press that shows them as victims, ""Trump Supporter Speaks out"", oh my gosh you're so disenfranchised. You're news-bait. We all know you hang in a Starbucks waiting for this kind of press, and the scum in T_D eat this shit up like it's the only thing happening in America right now.

But the sad reality is, is that hat represents every kid that Trump has killed at the border with his new inhumane policy. It represents every stupid tweet, every white nationalist terrorist attack in the world since Trump stoked their hatred with his racism. It shows you're OK with a pathological liar, a proven conman, holding the reins of the greatest country on earth. 

**That fucking hat** is a LOUD symbol that you're *ok with all that*.

4029,"Whenever I am exposed to a person grouping things together because they appear alike, I cannot help but remember that the human mind has evolved to recognized patterns, and in employing these patterns we often make egregious mistakes. While on the surface games and songs appear alike: They are both forms of entertainment developed by one entity and published/marketed by another, the two are both vastly different in both experience and production. A song is generally entirely judged on opinion, and that is why we have a pop-culture phenomenon where music that is appealing on a very shallow level generally makes the most sales. A videogame; however, has many factual points that can be utilized to examine and maintain a competitive market. I heard a story today that people can make user-generated missions in a new game called Infamous 2; it reminded me of playing custom game types back in a popular RTS called Starcraft Broodwar. My point is that having the ability to play user generated content is clearly superior to the opposite, and improvements like these SHOULD be mainstream with the ultimate goal being increasing the overall value of the product. 

A brief tangent: Most of the production that goes into a game is focused on the technical side of things. Having very few people writing and leading production allows the persons with an internal passion to float to the top; this leads to great, fully realized stories like that of the Mass Effect franchise. I don't think that the current trend video game development is following will lead us down the same path as the music industry.

I personally don't want to wait for the product to arrive in few days, at least when the price is not that much bigger. And if it is - than it's probably their own fault. I understand that they have bigger costs than online shops. But 50% higher prices? In conclusion, this can actually help lowering prices on the high street.

4141,"If you want to go try hard there's really only a few set ups that are usable. 

As assault you have to use the AEK,M16,AN94, or KH2002 personally i like to run with Heavy Barrel because of the added accuracy and better damage at mid range distances (where most gun fights occur). Fore-grips are personal preference on the M16 or AEK, i prefer them as they me recoil control a quite manageable especially when firing long bursts. Never put a fore-grip on the KH2002 or AN94, they are precision burst-fire weapons so recoil is not an issue and the added spread really hurts performance with these weapons. I wish it we'rent the case but the rest of the assault rifles are at a big disadvantage.

There are some more options when it comes to engineer, i find that there is less of a gap between the best and worst carbines compared to the best and worst assault rifles so there is more room for personal preference here. I love the M4-A1 it is an all around great gun and feels ALMOST like an assault rifle in my hands. It's got a great rate of fire and the recoil is pretty much identical to the M16. I would say about 90% of competitive players primarily use the M4-A1. The other picks for competitive are A-91,M-TAR,ACW-R, and an occasional G-53. The A-91 and M-TAR are great driver and gunner weapons, the M-TAR has it's absurd fire rate and the A-91 has a great hip-fire and also has a high rate of fire, slap a laser sight on either of these two and it's amazing at close range. The ACW-R is your go to long range weapon, it had a unique [damage model](http://symthic.com/bf3-weapon-comparison#14-18-02-02), where it does less damage at close range but does better damage at long range. The ACW also has a great reload time, almost zero recoil, and a very good fire rate make it amazing at anything above roughly 40m but if you run right into someone you will need to land an extra bullet to get the kill. I also enjoy using the QBZ, G36C, and SG553 but i feel they don't quite stack up as well as the others. The QBZ is quite nice because you can use both a Heavy Barrel and a laser sight making it a solid all around gun. All carbines (unless you are using it exclusively as a driver/gunner kit) should always have a Heavy Barrel, carbines suck at any kind of range so the added damage is a huge plus. I fore-grip all my carbines

You should have one support on a team at most, that's it, and he should just be trying to suppress everything in sight with a PKP or M240B. It might be best to just tape down the RT button. Recon is the fuck around class, it is pretty much useless but can be fun at times.


I'm pretty sure 99% of you already know everything i just said or you just plain didn't read it.

4164,"Summarized article: JPMorgan's chief investment officer Ina Drew will be stepping down as a result of the $2 billion trading loss revealed last week. 

Drew had offered her resignation after being with the bank over 30 years. She was one of the highest paid executives at JPMorgan. 

JPMorgan's co-chief of global fixed income Matt Zames will replace Drew as chief investment officer. 

The losing trades were made from JPMorgan's trading unit in London. The head of the unit as well as a member of the desk may also resign. 

The massive trading loss caused JPMorgan's shares to fall about 10% on Friday. On Monday, shares opened down another 3% at the time of writing.

Despite the loss, JPMorgan expects to post a $4 billion profit this quarter.

It's even possible that the crashing of certain stocks recently was done as part of a test of the market by R*. They ask all the beta players to do whatever it is that should cause a stock to crash and check that it works properly.

Manipulation will be harder, but I think still not impossible. All we need to do is push a stock up a little and then when people see it start to rise they will invest and it will snowball from their.

4282,">Is it women who have a tendency to develop late-onset diabetes have large babies, or vice versa?

It's actually that women with gestational diabetes have a tendency to develop both.

High glucose levels during pregnancy mean more energy available for fetal growth (not necessarily a good thing, since bigger babies make birthing difficult, and it can cause reflex hypoglycemia in the child post-birth).

And gestational diabetes is indicative of a difficulty regulating glycemia, which can worsen to become type-2 diabetes when regulation deteriorates due to aging.

Even mounted miniguns/.30 cal/.50 cal have quite a bit of weight and friction to them. It's not the same as waving an assault rifle around. And don't forget balance reasons.

On the plus side consoles get to use a controller analog stick when controlling vehicles. PC users have to drag the mouse and lift it repeatedly to turn a slow tank turret around. I don't know about you but I'd much rather prefer having the analog sticks where I can infinitely rotate the turrets with comfort.

People need to be made aware of the support subreddits so that they don't make the same mistake I did. It would also help if there were more subscribers, because I got a lot of kind words and support on my post on /r/aww, but the ones on the other subreddits don't get much. 

I think we need to make those communities bigger and put a note on the sidebar about where to post them and advertise for people who want to support people in the lost of their pet should go there.

4405,"Okay, I'm waiting for my croissants to cook so I'll type this up.

**Metro:** Maps such as Metro are hard to define. As long as a player isn't going into the out of bounds area to kill people, they're fine. If they do go into the enemy spawn which is out of bounds, that's spawn killing and they will be kicked/banned.

**Caspian Border:** Maps such as this are easy, if any vehicle is sitting in a spawn, waiting for whatever reason, and is fired upon/killed, it is spawn killing. Even if the vehicles are empty, you destroy an empty vehicle, it's classed under spawnkilling and players will be kicked/banned accordingly.

**Operation Firestorm:** Same as Caspian.

**Grand Bazaar:** If the US team is at the end of the alleyway of the RU deployment and killing players, that is spawn killing. It's hard to get out of there when you are constantly being fired upon and there are only 2 routes out of spawn, one being a small alleyway and the other being a road that is open and exposed. If a IFV is sat close to a spawn and it is firing in towards the spawn, that is spawn killing and players will be subject to kick/ban.

**Damavand Peak:** Mixture of Bazaar and Caspian. If the helicopter is taking out the enemy helicopter before it lifts off and gets decent altitude, it is spawn killing. If you have snipers anywhere looking at either spawn and killing players as they spawn, that is spawnkilling and players will be kicked/banned.

**Tehran Highway:** Fuck this map.

**Kharg Island:** Common sense, same as all other large CQ maps such as Caspian.

**Seine Crossing:** Same as Bazaar. If the US tank is in the deployment and has just spawned and has someone in it, you cannot shoot at it unless it moves/shoots/locks onto anyone. Same goes for the other spawn. If a tank/player is shooting into the enemy spawn, that is spawn killing and the player will be kicked/banned.

**Noshahr Canals:** This map is out of rotation due to massive baserapes. Will be added in later once rules are set out more clearly.

**Gulf of Oman:** Same goes on this map as Caspian i.e no shooting of enemy vehicles before takeoff/decent altitude is gained. For the US ship, allow the aircraft to get close to the land. Attack helicopters and jets can be fired upon as soon as they have lifted off and gotten a decent altitude but transport (or sport as they were referred to last night) cannot be fired upon until over land.

**Strike at Karkand:** CQA map, rules have been set out in the rules thread on CQA maps.

Anyone breaking any of the rules on the server will be kicked without warning. Further breaking of the rules will result in a ban length determined by the admin(s) on the server at the time and myself.

Enemies instantly teleporting out of burning tanks and shooting you. This would change player behavior and give them better decisions. My tank is disabled, burning and will explode. Should I ride it out to a final hurrah and take some enemies with me? or should I take the last remaining seconds to scramble out of the hatch and fight my way to cover? same goes for jets, in reality an ejection takes 3 seconds an animation would remove the annoying missed kill because the pilot instantly ejected at the last second. if you're good you can definitely get a kill if you can destroy the aircraft quickly before the pilot can eject in the three second window, but if you were just able to disable the craft you can miss a confirmed kill if the pilot decides to take his chance and eject.

World design :- Design will be almost the same (same art director) but the ""open world"" mechanic will probably be similar or closer to XII. No camping, no photo ops, no bro-ing out. A little bit more direct like the usual FFs.


Story :- Probably will be delivered better (because it's his game, a lot of his actual plans are in his head) and be a bit longer (read my last point) and some characters will probably be a little bit more fleshed out, Stella will probably have a little bit more dialogue but she'll be the Kairi of VersusXIII/XV. Less dialogues for the MCs (but if the story is longer, cancel the point), no banter. 


Release date :- Mid or Late 2017 or early 2018. He's a passionate and perfectionist kinda guy. Not pissing on Tabata, but announcing the release date too early and having a big event really backfired on himself. I like Tabata, he's honest and just as passionate but probably his upper ups are just too eager on getting their money and didn't trust him enough to get him more money and time.

>In 2017, Harris gave a public address to AIPACattendees. She said: ""I believe Israel should never be a partisan issue, and as long as I’m a United States senator, I will do everything in my power to ensure broad and bipartisan support for Israel’s security and right to self-defense.""[189] She has opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel.[190] Harris was a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[191][192][190] At the AIPAC conference, Harris said that ""the first resolution I co-sponsored as a United States senator was to combat anti-Israel bias at the United Nations"".[191] She also supported Senate resolution celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.[193][194] In late 2017, Harris traveled to Israel, where she met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[191]

>Calm down. It's not even primary season yet. They need to appeal to all Democrats right now, not just pro-Israel Democrats.

4705,"Yes, if in 100 trials ball 1 was never picked, or picked every time, but you know for a fact it is truly random, you would still say it has a chance of 1% per trial.

But in a real-world application, if you got 1 for all 100 trials, statistical analysis would give a very strong suggestion that it is not in fact random. There's something called a *p*-value, which is basically the probability that your result is due to random chance. Getting 1 on 100 trials has a *p* = 0.01^100 or 10^-200 . This is extremely low.

On the other hand, getting anything but 1 on all 100 trials has a *p* = 0.99^100 or about 0.366. Usually you would say a result is significant if *p* is less than or equal to 0.05 (5%). That is, if your *p* is less than 0.05, you would say it's most likely NOT due to random chance. So if *p* = 0.366, you have about a 36.6% probability it's due to random chance, and that's high enough that you could still say it's random.

Even if there had been beta testing there was no way to prepare for the influx of hundreds of thousands of people logging on at nearly the same time.

Just because you decided to give 343i $60 or $100 does not mean that they owe an absolutely perfect gaming experience on day one. We don't live in fucking LaLa Land, shit doesn't work perfectly every time and certainly not the first time.

Nobody wants this to be fixed more than 343i. It's their reputation, work, and money on the line.

This is the first time they've ever made a game so cut them a little slack. Overall they have done a fantastic job, not to mention a far better job than anyone expected of them.

4783,"I'm sure this will get downvoted, but I have to speak on it. I'm not a fan of science doing this. I'm a big fan of science in almost every other way but seriously, this is borderline ridiculous. I understand doing this for birth defects that endanger the child's health, but for the birth defects that don't do so, I think we need to let nature do its thing. I was born with a cleft palate, one of the worst my doctors had ever seen, and I think it has made me the man I am today. It has given me life experience that I could not possibly have had without it. It has taught me perseverance, humility, pain tolerance, how to direct my emotions, and the value of modern medicine. Most importantly, however, it has taught me the value of life, because it has almost killed me 3 times. After 16 surgeries and finally having it and its side effects fixed once and for all, I can honestly say that my cleft palate is in the top 5 best things to ever happen to me.

I've got mixed feelings about K:D ratios, it's nice to have indicators to how your doing and while I feel K:D ratios aren't the best way to do it (league of legends ""dominion"" map being a good example of objective based indicators) it's important to have something. 

**TL:DR** Kill-streaks and domination push players to be skittish, which can be bad for pushing objectives and objective based games.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&t=15s)

5212,"Hey there I've been trying to release an android version of the app, but our `CI` fails when releasing with the following message:

```bash
Google Api Error: apkNoUpgradePaths: You cannot rollout this release because it does not allow any existing users to upgrade to the newly added APKs. - You cannot rollout this release because it does not allow any existing users to upgrade to the newly added APKs.

We use `fastlane` to generate the `versionCode` but right now everything is sort of going highwire:

As of last night we have requested sidebar and rule access as those areas are both in dire need of updating. I’m going to hop on the computer and see what I can patch up with the permissions I do have a bit later.

5221,"1) I didn't make any such distinction. There's a reason - it's not valid. Both forums are morally corrupt. That's not the issue. The issue is that one forum (Gawker) is directed a celebrity and the other is directed at the private person (Reddit.) While the celebrity expose's are much more socially acceptable (see TMZ), the same thing on a non-celebrity level will cause greater concern as any non-celebrity person can identify or relate. Is this right? Of course not. Chen anchored his position on the socially unacceptable and distasteful. 

2) With regards to the Lohan pic, this is once again an attempt to justify or defend bad behavior by deflection. As for posted and removed underage celebrities? This is really not valid without some evidence or documentation. That's the same as saying creepyshots was okay because anything inappropriate was removed. 

3) I think you had better research the entirety of what VA was cited for before you make such a comparison. I'm reasonably certain that Gawker hasn't made comments to the effect of an ethically questionable liaison with one's stepdaughter, advocated (for trolling or otherwise) violence against women or or persons of a specific ethnicity, nor have they created or maintained a forum for others to do what I specifically mentioned here.",None,1350422299.0,Tue Oct 16 23:18:19 2012,-11.0,none,413070,0,,

5235,"Hey!

Well, this is what I know.

a) YouPorn has said that Redis is its 'primary data store'

b) YouPorn did _not_ tell me that it stores video in Redis

c) Redis _can_ store binary data, and video is binary data

So... basically I made the logical leap from 'primary data store' to 'it stores porn in Redis'.

The other thing is that YouPorn's Redis cluster handles 300k queries per second -- but only has 4000 PVs per second at peak time. I figured that big excess of queries could be explained by storing video in Redis.

It doesn't take much to kill you, and you absolutely need medical treatment for it.  Smokers are at higher risk because they have some CO already in their bloodstream.  Buy a CO detector, treat it like a smoke detector with replacing the batteries and testing it.

Also it's not completely related, but protect your eyes and ears!  Sounds over 80dB are loud enough to cause permanent, cumulative damage.  Listening to loud music through earbuds and headphones is especially bad.  If it hurts your ears, it's causing damage.

It's also surprisingly challenging at times. One of my biggest gripes is that it's always online. Yeah it's cool that you can always run into and challenge other players but there never seem to be that many other players in the same game as you, and for the love of God, let me pause the damn game.

5356,"I just don't get it. I really don't.

How can someone be so blinded by their faith that they cause this much detriment to their **own child** based on it's backwards ideals? At what point would this woman consider 'hey, maybe we're going *too* far with this'? When would the happiness and mental/emotional well being take precedence?

She and her husband need to take a good hard look at themselves. That comment was absolutely correct, it's child abuse. I hope that kid finds the love and support he needs when he's free of their oppression. And I hope to dear fucking God (irony intended) that his parents haven't fucked him up beyond repair already.

If by any slim chance he reads this, I say this:

You are not alone. Your parents are not right. Your parents have abused you and neglected you in their treatment of you. They betrayed your trust by assuring you you could approach them with anything and then restricting your basic rights to be a normal teenager, regardless of sexual orientation. You have every right to be angry, upset, confused and resentful towards your parent and the religion. 

But presumably if you are reading this, you're just 18. You've probably just left the family home and you're now free to live the life you envisioned. There is nothing holding you back now. You deserve to meet the most gorgeous guy and have the greatest butt fucking times of your lives. And you know what? If your parents can't prioritize your happiness over their close minded beliefs, that's their burden to carry, not yours. Be free of that oppression, live happy and live true. You're not shy of love and support that genuinely cares, you just have to see beyond the narrow-minded community your parents choose to exist in. Their beliefs may not allow for the love and acceptance of all regardless of sexuality, but basic human decency does.

If you ever need somebody to talk to and have the means to, please feel free to contact me. Even if later down the track when you have access to what your parents currently forbid, the offer remains. PM me, I'll give you my email, we'll talk about things, you can tell me about what you're feeling, whatever. Just please do not think you're 'wrong' in any way or need to change who you are. You are perfect the way you are and the way 'God' made you.",benji-21,1438355723.0,Fri Jul 31 17:15:23 2015,24.0,mod,"1,398,796",1,3291.0,0.0

If you go to the section in the spillway it’ll explain this event.

“Water spills over its lip when the lake reaches 1,602,000 acre feet (1.976×109 m3) and a reservoir elevation of 440 feet (130 m) above sea level. The last time the reservoir naturally spilled through the glory hole was on the afternoon of February 26, 2019.

Prior to that, the last time the spillway was active was February 16, 2017. After a number of storms had caused the lake level to rise 35.5 inches since January 1, 2017, the reservoir was on the cusp of spilling once again at 439.2 feet.[14] Eager to witness this event, a number of local boaters and recreation enthusiasts generated enough wake to cause the reservoir to spill, albeit briefly, at 1:45 p.m. on February 13, 2017. Lake Berryessa reservoir filled and ran into its glory hole spillway for the first time in over a decade on February 16, 2017, at approximately 3:00 p.m. PST .”",cutebot30366,1557704588.0,Mon May 13 01:43:08 2019,217.0,no mod,167683,1,552.0,0.0

5439,"In addition to 3226's awesome answer, another thing is that poorer people tend not to have great skills managing their money, while the richer folk do.

Case in point: me. If I had a million dollars I'd start buy buying a nifty new computer. A cheap car might be helpful. There's a few bits and bobs that I have lined up for when I do get money. Even when I was making a half-decent wage ($20/hr, not great, but not terrible) I ended up spending it on things, a TV, car repairs, computer parts, take out, etc. Stupidly I never set any aside, didn't have any savings for when I no longer had that job. I've never had a lot of money, I simply wouldn't deal well with having it.

On the other hand Bill Gates is excellent with money, he knows exactly how to save properly, live off a bare minimum, invest wisely, etc. He'd end up being rich again, and I'd end up being poor again. Sure, I'm a little smarter now than when I had that somewhat cushy job, but I have no doubt that I wouldn't save nearly as much as I should if I had it now. I prefer to maintain a lifestyle that is exactly within my means, no more no less. Rich people tend to know how to maintain a lifestyle that's well below their means.

Poor people aren't always poor because of the cards they were dealt, often they're poor because of the choices they make. Similarly rich people aren't always rich because they're assholes (though it certainly helps), they're rich because they know how to handle money properly.

5602,"Just to weigh in a bit...

I'd love to.  Like, let's fuckin' DO THIS.  Problem is, I currently work 6 days a week, afternoons through evenings.  This will change about halfway through summer however to roughly 4-5 days a week--and there's my girlfriend of 10 years--girlfriend gets a good portion of my free time cuz...well, you know.  If we are talking about one dedicated team practice night per week, then I can probably swing it no problem whatsoever.  I can give a tentative schedule of when I'm available should I be picked for a squad lead of course.  It's been a long time since I've done scrims in a game (going back to Tribes 1 lol) so I'd have to play it by ear as far as organizing practices for a while.
  

I definitely vote **Skitrel for infantry lead**.  Every time he's impressed me with something in-game, it's his AN-94.  To boot, he also *knows* why you use an M320 (GP-30 in his case) and not the medkit (100% agree) if you want to be an aggressive Assault.  To me, that makes him a necessary for running ground not to mention *who fucking organized this shit anyways?! lol*  If Chaos is willing to coach the air team then he's also got my respect and vote.  I've got 4 guys in my head that should be our air squad (doesn't include Chaos for not actually being on the team and thus isn't up for air lead consideration...right Chaos?) and of those 4, I'd vote **MWAD for air lead**.

From what I'm reading, it looks like I'm wanted as tank/ifv lead, and that's probably what I would pick if I could.  There's also someone who has played in our servers a few times that I've pubbed with before FREEHUGS existed that I'd absolutely love to have in a tank crew with me if you guys wouldn't mind my asking him (look up End YOUTHinASIA, he's also a redditor so *maybe* he'll read this?).

Of course, if I can't be available enough for the team's needs in the end, then I'll gladly be a difficult kill for you guys to practice against whenever I can at least :)",VashStampede222,1338272769.0,Tue May 29 08:26:09 2012,1.0,mod,114934,0,1021.0,0.0

Without going into too much detail, about 4 years ago my sister got into a near fatal accident skiing. She had a long road to recovery and had to learn how relearn to walk, eat, talk, read, etc. She was my best friend, and after having been there with her every step of recovery, I learned that connections we experience with people are beautiful, bittersweet, and important.
Since then I've made it a mission to value every moment with every person, and when I look back those times, I notice how much these people have impacted me and the way I live life. 
The most beautiful connections sometimes have bittersweet endings, but have made me grow into a person that I actually want to be.

These are the biggest, best, most sensational opening weekends.  They are not typical, but they *are* on the same order of magnitude for each number.  So if we're just going by the big ones, then everything is already in order and there's nothing to see here.

But really, we should be gathering a lot more data about the average games, instead of talking about the record breakers.  Statistical outliers are never a good thing to base decisions on.

5794,"Ok, honest question.  Is the gist of this post saying, if your gonna hate, spread it out?  Because here is my stance on these companies saying they have no stance on SOPA/PIPA.  These companies know that by saying they have no stance on it they prevent a big backlash if they say they are for it and they don't have to backpedal when they are relieved it passed.  It's akin to saying that I have no stance on gun rights but belong to the NRA because I like some of their stuff.  And that line of they want to stick with the ESA cause they agree with some of their agenda is also horseshit.  The ESA is the lobbying arm for the gaming industy, it exists to serve the industry and not the other way around.  So if these companies looked, saw how pissed a large(?) group of their customer base was about this legislation, they could make the ESA say what they want.  That's why it's there.  But that's not the case, for these companies it is more important that the next Call of Modern Kombat HD Remix doesn't get pirated.  Which is fair enough, they deserved to get paid for their work.  I guess what I'm saying is I agree with the spread it out if that's the point.

The number of things you can buy would plummet because modern production depends on concentrated money.  For example, upgrading an auto manufacturing plant costs millions.  With the money all spread out, who would pay for that?  So, we could all kiss our cars, airplanes, computers, and cell phones good bye.

For a while we would have eliminated the disparity between rich and poor because everyone would be poor.  Very poor.

But, then some enterprising souls would convince large numbers of people to lend them some of their money to restart production.  They would become very rich providing the things that everyone wanted.  And the disparity between rich and poor would return.

5979,"I think Israel should continue to do exactly what it's doing. It seems most of you forgot that without Israel there would be no Palestine where it is today. Also, no Arab government would ever give away any of its land to form a Palestine like Israel did in 2008. Don't forget that from 1948 to 1967, Jordan controlled the West Bank and thwarted all Palestinian attempts to create a nation. 

It bothers me when people expect Israel to supply water and electricity to the Palestinians. Israel and Palestine are not friends. Israel does not need to give water and electricity to the people who signed a unity deal last year with Hamas, the internationally recognized terrorist organization hell bent on destroying Israel. If Palestine hopes to become a sovereign nation, you'd assume they would be able to get their own water. 

When it comes to peace between Israel and Palestine, the  Palestinians are the bigger hindrance. The Annapolis Conference in 2007 is usually a forgotten subject. in 2007 at this conference, Ehud Olmert, the then PM of Israel proposed a peace deal with the Palestinians. Essentially it said Palestine would get the West Bank aside from large settlements but would also get more land in Israel in return. Also Jerusalem would be a shared city. However, like just about every offer before it, the Palestinians leadership rejected it.

I also support Israel based on the way its citizens are treated. All people are granted every basic human right in Israel. In the West Bank, honor killings have now become trite, just as the public executions of ""Israeli Collaborators"" in Gaza have too. (Last week Hamas announced that they were going to kill ten of them!) Real lives with real opportunities can be lived in Israel. 

One more thing. I am a man.

6015,"There's no real treaty for this.

It's not *entirely* hypothetical.  We are in a time where discovering things of great value to multiple parties in International Waters is plausible.  Undersea mining... oil/nat gas fields that could never be mapped or drilled before are becoming more plausible to exploit.

Also similar, the arctic was pointless to claim before, so no one argued claims to it.  Now, it's got some value and promise of ever-increasing value and lots of countries are arguing ownership.

Space exploration, too.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_Sea_Convention

Exclusive economic zones extend 200NM from the low-water mark on the shore.  

In International Waters, the seabed floor is ""controlled"" by [International Seabed Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Seabed_Authority), but it's kind of a joke.  It's a small body which meets infrequently and doesn't carry a lot of authority.  The US wants the ISA dropped.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind

Is the principle that says the Moon cannot be claimed or exploited by any one country.  That really wouldn't hold up if something of significant commercial value showed up there.

Common Heritage of Mankind definitely wouldn't hold if a new, usable continent showed up. 

Basically a clusterfuck.  I expect the following:

1.  We made the first landing there and own the whole thing

2.  No, a fishman of your nationality, not your government, landed there first.  Actually we landed there 2 days before that you just didn't hear about it.  Basically it will be a claim no one respects, except for the person claiming the flag-planting.

3.  Country A is closest point to a shore, we own the whole thing.

4.  No, Country B owns the half facing its country

5.  We should all divide it up to ALL COUNTRIES EQUALLY based on existing country size (hurray Russia)

6.  No, we should divide it up based on population (hurray China)

7.  Most countries: well when we say ""divide it up"", we don't actually want to USE it and have territory next to you.  We'll SELL our claim to another country.  So, like, the US or Russia or China should just give us a boatload of $$$ to ALL these little guys who never set foot on the place, just because they exist.

8.  Some minority offended in the past: Native Americans should occupy it since you took our country.  It's a new Jewish homeland, it's Zion but we never really knew what that meant until now.

On point #7... let's say someone finds a way to get a valuable resource off the Moon.  But only one country has the tech to TAKE it.  Maybe it's such a specific product only that country can even *use* it.  Still, other countries would demand payment for their *rights* to it.  Not necessarily cash, they would more likely use it as a political pawn- ""if you want to mine the lunar regolith for Helium-III to make fuel to go to Mars, then China demands you recognize our rightful claim to the Diaoyu Islands and we will not stop you.""  ""But you don't have any interest or ability to mine that Helium-III!""  ""And you have no interest in colonizing the Diaoyu Islands, nor does Japan.  So back China's claim and that works out nicely.""  Then Japan backs off and says ""well we WERE going to greenlight your Moon-mining plan because it made sense, but now we see that's a mistake.  No, WE will block it unless Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands are recognized as JAPAN'S claim!""",Oznog99,1394645297.0,Wed Mar 12 18:28:17 2014,166.0,mod,"419,772",1,721.0,1.0

That is why Marx was such a fan of capitalism, at least it's tremendous power to break traditional social bonds (e.g. feudalism) and reconfigure them to---increasingly collectively---generate enormous wealth, i.e. defeat scarcity.

But the expectation that such collectively created tremendous wealth, concentrated as private property in the hands of a small group would lead to social upheaval and a surpassment of that configuration seemed a bit to optimistic.

After all, we are gutting social programmes to patch up after the greed of a small financial elite, whose [$18 trillion in offshore assets](http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/IMF_100315_Trillions.pdf) dwarf any proposed cut.

This can work in Battlefield if they made the animations appropriately fast. But if the animations were as long as they are in the SP & CoOp missions, then that would just be aggravating.

Men work longer hours, make more sacrifices for the high paying job (harder major, take pay over balance benefits, commute to work longer, etc...), and retire at a later age. None of which is opinion.

I think its obvious that men's work/role consists of them having to be more competitive and getting less balance. And having men retire later in life even though they die sooner is just cruel. I'm not saying men working habits are the only reason for, say, the much higher rates of suicide but I'm sure it is a large contributor.

It would help cut down on posts asking for help where answers have been given time and again. Those newcomers to the community often end up feeling neglected, when really it is just a simple matter of ""this has been asked so many times I don't feel like answering."" Instead, we could just redirect those people, via bot, to one of the previously sticky'd threads that would have tons of input on how to build that RDA best.

6264,">So clearly, spending habits have changed drastically since 2007, or the numbers are somehow otherwise in disagreement.

Your source is calculated incorrectly. Dividing revolving debt by the population doesn't work because revolving debt is not exclusively credit card debt. Corporations commonly use revolving debt to finance daily operations, and that's why the number there is so inflated.

> Perhaps people of your age range might be, but if you include the college students carrying $25k balances for decades at a time, people don't appear quite so frugal.

That's personal experience. The Fed SCF I linked to breaks down credit card debt by demographic. There isn't a specific demographic for ""college students"", but most of the demographics for college student qualities - under 35, single, college educated, low net worth percentile - are right in line with the rest of the population. A $25k credit card balance for a student would be a statistical outlier.

>and consumers who pay off their credit card balances every month are losses to them. Too many of them would drive them bankrupt. That's why if you do that, pay off your cards every month, your credit record suffers for it.

Whenever you use your credit card, the merchant is charged a fee as a percentage of sales. This fee is split between Visa/Mastercard and the issuer. They are still profiting even if you deny them interest payments. Paying off a balance in full every month to maintain a good credit score is a myth; a Google for ""carry balance credit score"" will pull up a lot of information on this. Credit scores evaluate creditworthiness, not profitability. In the big debt picture, interest on credit card debt is pocket money. The vast majority of consumer debt is non-revolving, and a lot of that is pooled by banks into asset-backed securities where the most important quality is default risk.",None,1327558812.0,Thu Jan 26 07:20:12 2012,2.0,none,413070,0,,

6388,"I agree with Charming_man here, he is playing rather loose with the term capitalism. But i think it is also just plain corruption and incompetence in spotting and dealing with it. Greece for instance didn't get its debt through the crisis, they just gave false numbers for ten years.

Of course, capitalism has many potential faults, i guess many of them can be attributed to people themselves. For instance, the marketing-based television; apparently it is hard to find a scheme where people would not rather watch commercials for time t even though the watchers working the equivalent of a time t/10 would get rid of the commercials. Now everyone has to pay for the programmes *and* the advertising through a 'tax' via the products advertised. Basically that is happening again on the internet, although the price of running youtube is relatively lower than generating content. However, the effect of how we support google by using their websites/being observed is potentially more insidious.

Anyway, although capitalism has faults, in reality it is mixed up with government, regulations and such. Besides, capitalism leaves people somewhat free to do things their own way within it too large extent. We just have to keep at bay the suits with their 'intelectual property', who would try control universities, put everyone in someones pocket by giving people duties they have no right to assign, or using rules set -but not necessarily meant- by other overzealous suits trying to cover different things.",Jasper1984,1315252305.0,Mon Sep  5 21:51:45 2011,2.0,mod,413070,0,10959.0,0.0

6518,"I think a problem in America is its perception on China. We perceive them as a threat and as a rival, and we expect them to view us much in the same way.

The Chinese are nervous about the U.S. presence in Asia. Yes, the U.S. doesn't want to see an expansionist China. I'm not so sure that's really a concern. I'm not ignoring Taiwan, but I'll get to that in a bit. Our presence in Japan and South Korea is geared towards three countries: North Korea, China, and Russia. 

North Korea exists because of China. I could go into further detail about this, but it's not very important for the context in discussion. China doesn't particularly like North Korea, nor does it really consider the DPRK as an important ally. The Chinese support North Korea for a few reasons:

1) Because a DPRK collapse would create a massive refugee crisis. China does not want to deal with this.

2) It's a proxy to U.S.-backed South Korea. The Chinese don't want American troops on its border. I cannot find the source right now, but a CRS report I read a few months ago indicated that the Chinese have gestured that they'd be willing to support a unified Korea, under a South Korean model, without U.S. troops stationed there. This would put the U.S. in a tough military and diplomatic spot: Our forces in South Korea are ostensibly a deterrent to North Korea, but at the same time, they serve as a presence to deter China, as well. 

Which brings me to Taiwan. China wants it back, and I think they'd likely be willing to use war as an option, should the U.S. get bogged down in another conflict (say, a North Korea invasion of South Korea). It's really a tough spot for us to be in. Would anybody be willing to support a war preventing a Chinese takeover of Taiwan? That's a very possible flashpoint for the current dynamics of the world, and it's not something that can easily be postponed. The absolute ""best"" solution I can think of that would be to set Taiwan up in a similar manner to Hong Kong. I know the issue of sovereignty of Taiwan comes into play, but I think it's better than triggering a massive war. I certainly don't want to see such a war take place.

Anyway. We'd hit up this machine before, but this time I nailed it on the second try (the first being a rare case of my OWN error, and not the light jumping on its own). We cleared that thing OUT. We got two Nintendo DS's, a PSP, a Madden video game, some sweet headphones, and a couple other goodies.. Then hauled-ass right to the car and went home, completely forgetting why we came to the mall in the first place..

Objectively, it's probably not worth the money at that price. The taste isn't going to be miles above the 18, and it's not much different either.

But... But. It's not really about what's in the bottle, is it? What you're paying for is presentation. It comes in a wooden box, it's got a big 21 on it, and it probably tastes just fine to someone who doesn't have a lot of experience. It, like Johnnie Walker Blue Label, is more about the prestige than it is the liquid, and for $260, it's hard to get more prestige than Glenlivet 21.

As a birthday present for someone who's not super into single malts, but recognizes the name Glenlivet far more than he would recognize Glenfarclas or GlenDronach or whatever other recommendations you'd get, it's going to feel like a big present, and not just from a financial perspective. 

So ultimately, it's up to you. Your dad will probably love it more than he would love 4 bottles of daily drinkers, but you're not going to be getting more objective quality than you would from those 4 bottles.

6687,"Great question! You're starting down a very interesting path in your thought experiment, related to probability and statistics.

Here's one way of thinking about it. If the lotto machine is truly random, then every time somebody comes to draw a ball out of the machine, it is what's known as an ""[independent event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_\(probability_theory\))."" In other words, previous draws have no influence on future draws. This is just like the coin flip: just because the previous flip came up heads, that doesn't change the fact that the next coin flip has a 50/50 shot of heads (and a 50/50 shot of tails).

So...when you go to draw a ball from the lotto machine, that draw has a 1/100 (1%) chance of being ball #1. Then, you put the ball back. The next draw has a 1/100 (1%) chance of being ball #1 as well.

You can ask some fun questions now. What is the chance of drawing ball #1 twice in a row? It turns out to be (1/100) * (1/100) = (1/10,000) = 0.01%.

Similarly, what is the chance of drawing ball #42, then ball #55? It's also 0.01%.

Have fun! And, don't fall prey to the ""[gambler's fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler\'s_fallacy).""",tbagman,1410586633.0,Sat Sep 13 07:37:13 2014,1.0,no mod,"419,772",1,3.0,0.0

Honestly, if there are karma whores it's your jobs as moderators and admins to be on the ball about it if you're really serious about running this subreddit and making it better than the bullshit in gamingnews or whatever.

Of course, true to point, you can't even see how many upvotes or downvotes this post has. You're complaining about downvotes to this post but... how would we know?! You removed the Karma number. I have no frame of reference. Nobody does.

6911,"There are major, major concepts that separate DayZ, H1Z1, and 7DtD.

To get right to the point:

H1Z1 has the most transparent game as far as development so far. It offers many features DayZ players are waiting for, such as increased zombie numbers/difficulty, larger servers, more in depth crafting etc.

I can't say graphically that the game is better than DayZ, although night looked amazing on the livestream. I'm sure highest graphical settings won't be horrid.

Also, 7DtD is a voxel based game and, although crafting is a major part of both that and H1Z1, it appears to be much less ""minecrafty.""

Also, as per the mmo and server structure they've set up, they're going to have a lot more options and freedom and adjusting the game to the players.

Ultimately, I would say DayZ is the ""PvP"" zombie survival game.

7DtD is the definitive crafting/voxel based zombie survival game.

H1Z1 will hopefully fall right in the middle, with enough of a player base and enough environmental difficulties to prevent it from becoming a PvP centered game (like DayZ).

Also, 7DtD can't have more than 16 players on that same, tiny map. I could maybe fit half of the average BP squad I roll with into one of those games.

 It's pretty much just a login to acess specific information. I guess I could build based on a school grade management app or something, so, do anyone know any tutorials that could guide through something like that?

* I also mod in /r/doodleordie and know how to spot spam (usually not too difficult)

* I consider myself friendly and helpful in the fact that I (especially on Reddit) try not to call people stupid if they say something incorrect, but I will politely correct them with references.  Also if somebody is more knowledgeable about a topic than I am, I will not make up answers to try and make myself look smarter, but I will listen to the advice/information they have to offer and add it to my growing brain-library of knowledge.

As for the bugs discussed in this post, they said they would be fixed in this last patch and they still haven't.

You could, theoretically, kill bosses until you got a Good Drop for what you wanted, but there's a thread going around explaining The Math on how rare it is to get anything ""good.""  Your only way to hedge the bet is to craft, craft, craft.  To craft many things you need HE divtech in droves.  What's the best way to get divtech?  Not actually playing the game per se, so much as box farm and slot machine sim 2016.

Your options basically are:

Wait every week and hope the vendors roll a decent enough pre-rolled item you can buy with PXC, at the mercy of RNG.

Get gear ""naturally"" by killing bosses/doing the daily, at the mercy of RNG.

Craft gear ""naturally"" by using what you get in the meantime from doing dailies/DZ, at the mercy of RNG.

Farm like it's Harvest Moon and craft 500x the same thing until a perfect one rolls out, punching RNG in its stupid, stupid face.

No, box sim 2016 is not fun, but it's also the only real option anyone has to get anything better than the 31 purples they get at a 10,000% rate compared to HEs.  You're fighting drop rate x rng item type x rng every affix/talent/etc.  It's all about rate and churn, and nothing about effort or method.

I think it is just a lucky coincidence that you guys both chose $88.88.  8s are considered lucky in Asian culture so it is not all that far-fetched that multiple people would choose that as their bid amount when they go to snipe.

7165,"I'm on vacation, so I don't have my copy of Capital on me, but let me give it a try from memory.

Basically the idea is that capitalism requires that, at some point in the chain of commerce, surplus-value is created. Capital can't exist without profit. He then goes on to discuss how profit can be created, and comes to the conclusion that it is impossible to do so only by one's own labour. This is true because whenever two people meet in the market they are exchanging products of equal value, or actually an amount of money that has the same value as a certain product (by definition of what value is). Thus when you sell the product of your own labour, you only get as much as your labour is worth, and there are no profits.

So the problem is that you can't generate profit through your labour, and you can't generate it in the market. That is the contradiction. What's the solution? You underpay other people for their labour and then sell it in the market at its actual value. That's how you generate the profits necessary for capitalism. Thus capitalism necessitates inequality, and is the source of all inequality. This is what shaggy1054 was talking about.

7240,"I visit this subreddit pretty much daily and like it the way it is - moderation is just right. People can be snarky regarding certain news items or have deep meaningful discussion. I enjoy reading both.  
Regarding Q&A items - there are more appropriate places for them, like, AMA ,specific games or dev subreddits. I think that a message with a link to said gaming related Q&A can be enough.  
My suggestion is to practically remove the up / down voting options. As mentioned, this subreddit does not get many submissions per period of time so checking all news items of the last day or two isn't that time consuming. I also think that the voting system is not benefiting news items (""...the subreddit seeks to remain an unbiased and informative place"").

I'm simply saying that having a vote on an individual moderator is a bad idea because most people here probably don't know much about any individual moderator.  You'll get selection bias in who actually bothers to vote.  Or if he's such a bad moderator, he might get a bunch of friends to vote for him.

And besides, if he's such a terrible moderator it should be obvious to any half-way decent moderator.  And if he's a terrible moderator and the other mods can't (or won't) recognize it, then we've got a bigger problem with the moderators than a single rogue.

As it stands, news sources write headlines for explicit editorial purpose to attract hits and tweets, sell ads, provoke reader responses, etc. Requiring /r/Canada to discuss our stories and concerns through the lens of arbitrary headline writers does not foster a unique discussion here, but merely continues the low-quality discussions found at the comments sections of the original stories.

7395,"> You think ""mob rule"" is a good thing?

We're not talking about anarchy. In pre-Revolution America, there were literally mobs who imposed justice, and these getting out of hand was what the Founding Fathers mostly feared. Obviously, this shouldn't happen. On the other hand, they established a constitution that barred people *below a certain level of income from voting.* Needless to say, I find that abominably arrogant, ignorant and stupid.

> Quoting the founders, however, is generally a good idea because many of their ideas were correct.

They had many good ideas (often borrowed from Enlightenment philosophers), but referring to them as an authority is intellectually lazy and glosses over their flaws.

> Slavish devotion will never turn ideas like equal protection under the law to all people bad.

I was never arguing against that. That is an integral part of any modern state (the concept, though, arose with French philosophers).

However, the electoral college has proven itself a highly undemocratic, unnecessary and unduly distorting force. Really, it should be abolished. Also, the Constitution's idea of federalism is outdated: A stronger government is needed to enforce civil liberties, as the conflicts during the Civil Rights era showed. Too much in America is left to the states, enabling sectarian rivalries and regional power imbalances due to their differing size. On the other hand, trying to balance out these imbalances creates ridiculous power-grabbing by smaller states, skewing the representation of the people. There are many things wrong with the American state/political model, but its discourse has long been to poisonous and emotional to make meaningful change for the better.",None,1327518223.0,Wed Jan 25 20:03:43 2012,2.0,none,413070,0,,

You're talking about a deity whose existence is (essentially *by definition*) indistinguishable in principle from its non-existence. This is the [invisible dragon in Carl Sagan's garage](http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Dragon.htm). Relevant quote:

> Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?  If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?  Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true. Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder.",blokhead,1309015789.0,Sat Jun 25 17:29:49 2011,1.0,no mod,114934,0,872.0,0.0

Personally, I doubt there's going to be much difference between the two consoles.  The games for the PS3 and 360 were pretty much the same, despite serious differences in the hardware in those consoles.  I have a feeling it's going to be a question of which console gets more exclusives, because the games that come out for both are going to play pretty similarly on both.

7579,"Just gonna ask:

1) If you are really going to go ahead with this idea then wouldn't it be a good idea to put /r/dating_advice on the subreddit description? As well as other sub-subreddits in the /r/relationships community?

2) Why do the mods here feel the need to separate /r/relationships into a plethora of subreddits? Wouldn't that just confuse new posters and furthermore, is it even necessary or ideal at all to do such a thing?

Hell, I was confused by what the hell the ""Part of the /r/Relationships community"" background meant before I read this post.

3) Won't this cause an already growing oversaturation in love/dating/relationship related subreddits? Popular examples being:

7587,"This was a very gripping tale.  I felt like I was right there with the author in the moments after the blast, dazed and immobilized, and unable to  help.   I feel like I have no right to comment or criticize given what the author went through, but I feel it necessary to question the following: 

>A rifle in my hand changed me from a regular joe to a Blood-Thirsty Killer. My suicide bomber must have felt the same feelings the first time he tried on his suicide vest.

It seems to me that there is a crucial difference between the typical soldier and a suicide bomber.  While it is true that both are putting themselves in harm's way, the soldier, like the police officer or the fireman is not actually *planning* to die.  I know little about the military training, but I imagine that a great deal of effort is placed on the tactics of survival, and that survival plays an important role in the optimal outcome of military strategy.  If that is not the case, then I respectfully suggest that they are doing it wrong.  ",optimister,1317582803.0,Sun Oct  2 21:13:23 2011,3.0,mod,413070,0,5272.0,0.0

7619,"Okay, I have done some searching in the [area this dish points to](http://i.imgur.com/Qu6oFSc.jpg?1), and here is what I've come up with.

 [This](http://i.imgur.com/t7uJfL4.jpg) pic shows the locations of the dish, with the player arrow standing on the dish facing as close as I can get to the exact direction it is pointing. It may be off a tiiiiny bit because it's hard to get hime to point in the *exact* direction I want.  Every time he takes a step he pivots a bit.

The first POI in line is where the two silos with the drawings are located.  The waypoint was just a ballpark for when I headed out that way to look around and may or may not be relevant.  

The next POI out in the ocean was these peculiar shaped [rock formations](http://i.imgur.com/EvjG2yz.jpg), which are all lined up with each other in the direction the dish points.  Also may not be relevant, but interesting nonetheless. **EDIT:** *These rocks may be what the hippie is referencing when he says 'If you look at a satellite map the rocks line up', or similiar.  Could be something to these.*   I did some diving around here with the sub but didn't find anything interesting and it drops off below crush depth pretty quick just past them.  There is also a small building on one of the islands there with a couple people around a fire, but didn't see anything there either.

The furthest POI out is the *approximate* location where the numbers station can be heard on the radio, based on [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uJmUNL18Ec) youtube video.

Something else I found interesting were these [lines](http://i.imgur.com/Jvtmrpp.jpg) crisscrossing the sky, with Mt. Josiah in the background.  Are they just normal plane contrails?  I've never seen them before so I thought it was worth posting.  This pic was taken from the rocks mentioned above.  


My theory is that the dish is possibly pointing at the area where the numbers station can be heard, which would be logical since that's what these type of dishes are designed for - capturing radio waves.  That area doesn't line up quite as well as the silos, but it seems to me that the radio waves would be a more likely target.

Cut soda outta your diet, and try to cut down on carb-heavy food.  Cardio also, doing atleast 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week will drop the weight fast.

Well done on the write up; you're thoughts mirror my own right up to not having a great way to smoothly transition from Sim to FPS controls.  The only shortcoming of the Rift that you missed is the fact that there's no good way to show an observer what you're seeing short of putting your Rift on them.  Short of rendering the game twice, once for the stereoscopic Rift and once for a standard monitor, your only option is to clone the Rift to a monitor and display what we saw during the CES demos.

They were forced to take TARP under the threat of regulatory non-compliance. The reason that JP Morgan parked the cash in T-bills was because they had no strategic plan for its use AND wanted the cash available to pay back the government as soon as the government would let it.  

This is how opinions like FenrirIII's get formed -- the government forces ALL the major banks to take TARP money and then forever after people go around talking about how the taxpayer owns these banks.

For their radar and anti-aircraft and anti-missile defenses: Balloons. That's right, balloons loaded up with aluminum to light up their radars. Using the prevailing winds with tens of thousands of balloons, each of which will appear as large as a B-52 on their radar, they will respond by initiating a response in the form of anti-missile/aircraft missiles and other armament. The operation will begin at night, on a moonless or overcast sky at 2AM or 3AM on the first night. At 1;14 or 2:44AM on the third night. At 11PM on the fourth night. On the third or fourth or the 2nd and third and 5th nights a missile will fly over Iran from North to South at low altitude. Aircraft will fly near Iran's borders on every day of this plan. Want to hear more? About the 8 large dams in Iran? About the one gasoline refinery in Iran. About the blockade of goods to Iran? About the 800 electricity generating stations in Iran? About the communications networks in Iran? About how quickly and how efficiently and effectively water and gasoline and electricity and communications will shut down in Iran. Ask me about the Aurora.

7790,"You have a point that the author uses quite a broad stroke, touching relatively shallow on the ideas of Marx, the historical evolution, class dynamics, etc. On each of these broad points one can interject with remarks or requests for clarifications.

However, I'm not sure your questioning of his definition of capitalism is of much help. It seems sufficiently clear that the author is referring to the general conception of capitalism, i.e. a system of social relations and trade, based on private property and free markets.

There is no possible way the author is writing ""capitalism as Marx saw it"", but actually means ""modern warfare/welfare state"" or ""corporatism"" or ""mixed economy"".

7797,"The issue SF is trying to solve is called ""public vagrancy."" We already have many laws on the books to address this problem, going back a hundred plus years.

Obviously SF cannot house or rehabilitate any poor soul who wanders our way. Those of us who have been watching this clown show for 3+ decades now know that SF will never solve ""homelessness."" Even the full power and resource of the Federal government would likely have a hard time utterly addressing this huge societal problem, much less a small city of 800K with a disproportionate homeless population.

The solution to public vagrancy, as I've stated many times before here, is to aggressively remediate and enforce against the things we are actually objecting to (public shitting, public drug use, public drunkenness, drug dealing, etc).

We all feel terrible people aren't housed, but the primary issue we're trying to solve - the things we actually object to the most - are the shit, the needles, the insane behavior, the camps, etc.

SF is somewhat hobbled (and helped, too) by a continual stream of newcomers who don't really know that we've already had all hands on deck on this issue for almost 30 years. So their bright-eyed-bushy-tailed optimism around actually \*solving homelessness\* (which sounds ludicrous to many who have observed failed city attempts to do such for decades), is a slight hindrance to addressing the actual quality of life issues we object to. Their well-intentioned naive optimism will take 5-10 years to turn to hardened cynical realism, but they will be a political force all the way through, shaping policy, wasting more time as they learn it isn't so simple - what the rest of us learned long ago.",MustLetTomPickOnion,1556792328.0,Thu May  2 12:18:48 2019,3.0,mod,12273,0,9990.0,0.0

I really do apologize, it was me and my friends (ghettocarebear8) first time on that server and we are a bit confused as to what spawn trapping exactly meant. I mean we had all the objectives and we were confused as to what we were supposed to do. Were we supposed to just let you guys take A AND B? On Seine, holding A can be pretty difficult if you don't funnel the enemy to either of the bridges from the US spawn, considering if we were to back off you have that path along the road to the back side of both objectives 100% completely unguarded. I obviously was the offender so my word doesn't mean much but I am sorry if what me and my friend did broke your servers rules. We are still getting used to play on server guidelines. Its hard to remember when you've been programmed the last few months to do exactly what we did. 

So, apologies all around. I know this game is obviously to have fun and on the server even more so. I will try personally to watch out for spawn trapping.

Everyone always goes for what's popular and the only reason we all seem to think it's getting worse is that we don't remember the Sockets or the Normy's Beach Babe-O-Ramas of the past.

I do think there is some stagnation but there have always been big sellers that everyone follows. And while some innovation may come from the Indie scene, a lot of that is just copying off some aspect of previous games. If you look at the biggest indie games, they may have brought something new but not any more so than big developers. Braid's rewind ability was done with Sand's of Time; Limbo doesn't have anything particularly unique about it; Super Meat Boy is retro and difficult but not all that innovative; World of Goo is great but isn't particularly unique; Monday Night Combat is basically a mix between TF2 and DoTA. There are some like AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA! and Minecraft that offer something new but the vast majority of indie games aren't that great and aren't particularly innovative. Look at how many of them rely on black/white or bland coloring and how many of them are 2D platformers.

At the same time, the vast majority of mainstream games aren't that unique either but there are some interesting ideas in them. For example, MindJack and Epic Mickey were both failures but they did offer some innovation. Mindjack had the idea transporting multiplayer into the single player game and Epic Mickey with the idea of erasing and recreating aspects of the world everywhere. They may have been based on ideas from other games before, but they were still an interesting way of implementing it. And let's not forget that games like Portal, Assassin's Creed, Mirror's Edge, Split/Second, Mario Galaxy, and Alpha Protocol are all mainstream games that have added at least a bit to their genre (portal gameplay, parkour style movement, controlled demolition of the track in a racing game, alterations in gravity, and timed decision making/enemies reacting to your previous decisions respectively). Sure many of those aren't major changes but then again most of gaming is an iterative process where changes come slowly. Otherwise the bugs in the systems would never be ironed out and we'd have tons of innovation with terrible implementation.

What I'm really saying is that I don't see indie gaming as being any more unique than mainstream. Both provide innovation in their own way, both often copy off other games but implement the choices in unique ways, and both have a majority of crappy titles that copy others. The difference is we only tend to remember the good stuff from indie games and retro games but analyze every little mainstream game and conclude that the big gaming companies are all crap and don't innovate.",None,1299092719.0,Wed Mar  2 20:05:19 2011,10.0,none,114934,0,,

The inviting Free Hugs II (HUGS) Crew (a sequel to the maxed out Free Hugs I) use their Subreddit mainly for membership driving and as a forum for members to ask questions and connect with each other - clearly a smart means of expanding recruitment efforts.

Our crew is /r/freehugsgtafive

Didn't know about you [RACC guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosMapaches/), grats on the shoutout too.

8063,"This seems incredibly scripted...not so much because of the content, but because of the execution. 

First off, on a reality show people typically have a lavalier microphone on them.  Usually this is done quickly and pretty sloppy, so there would be a good chance it would be under his jacket (You can hear a sudden rubbing of the lav when he pulls the jacket off).  For some reason this sound mixer took the time to put it underneath the man's undershirt and took care to hide the wire. In other words they knew the jacket was coming off, he is very meticulous,  or he got very lucky.  

Secondly, the camera angles don't make sense for the pace of the action  if it was a spontaneous real life event.  There is a wideshot of the security guards going up to them, then two perfectly composed over the shoulder shots of both of them.  This is a judgement call, but the perspective of the shot doesn't look flat enough for it to be that serious of a zoom.  In other words the wide shot should have had two cameras in it if it all happened in real time.

Neither of these shots are hand held...so it was rather nice of both them and the security guards to line up perfectly so as to not block each other.  There are rapid cuts all over the place.  This show either has the best 4 camera operators in the business, or 10 cameras running at all times...or its mostly scripted.  Then at the very end there is a wide shot they shows so much of the room there is no way a camera shouldn't be in it if we are to believe it is only seconds after the previous exchange. At the very least the cutaways to the others were done later.

The final straw though are the cameras following his exit through the various halls as he leaves.  I sincerely doubt there are cameras (with operators) sitting in every hall waiting to follow people who happen to storm off set.  At the very least those shots were done later after the guy calmed down and not part of the initial storm out.

The interview at the end with the gear in the background.  That gear is staged in a bizarre pointless way that makes very little sense (except if you are just trying to get a ""hey this is a set"" kind of look in the background).

* the karkand maps be looked at because some of those railings cannot be shot through (even though they are wide open such as the Sharqi Penninsula railings) and others are very hard to jump over (an example would be some of the building's railings on Gulf of Oman).

* that the MAV is changed so that people cannot stand on top of it (because of exploits).

* that we get some sort of upvote/downvote system for the servers or at least some way to comment on the servers (maybe only friends could see this comment?) as well as a way to hide servers that you do not like.

* that the terrain hit boxes be fixed... It's annoying when you scope, shoot and instead of hitting your target you somehow hit the edge of the rock you are hiding behind.

* that people using soflam's get points whether or not they are personally guiding the laser or short of that, reward more points per assist.

* that our soldiers don't get killed by ""falling"" 3 feet off of a rock.  :(

* that that there be a platoon statistics page where the top platoons would be displayed based on stats that they have accrued during the week (or all time).  I just think this would be a nifty little addition (if this already exists please point me in the correct direction).

* that DICE be a bit more transparent with what they are looking into and what they are close to completing.  I know that attachments and such are being looked at and that VOIP is also being looked at, but what else is going on?  Any information about DLC (or the different weather requests/times of day)?


PS: I think DICE did a great job with this game and I love it so much.  I just have high expectations of BF3 (I don't mean to come off as a dick or anything) and hope to see the game improve.

8269,">What I'd love to see is a system whereby all moderators have to vote to add our remove someone, and if the vote is more than 50% them that person is added/removed. 

That's a terrible idea, and would make current moderation problems even worse. That automatically gives every mod who's not around a ""no"" vote. Which means any community that has enough inactive mods is at a standstill. 

It gets rid of the strict mod hierarchy, sure, but it doesn't do anything about the problem of tonnes of subs that are stacked with old mods who don't actually moderate and do the bare minimum to keep from being removed for inactivity.

It also further encourages moderators who start communities to load them with alts.

Now, with a few changes it could work well. If there was a time limit on this, so that mods *had* to vote, or forfeited their vote, that might work a bit better. But it still wouldn't solve the issue of the people who very old reddit accounts who snapped up tonnes of subs, and don't really do moderation work, but still retain a grip on the community.

What you'd really need would be for this to be done in conjunction with reddit changing policies on removing inactive mods. If mods could go to redditrequest and show a body of evidence that a moderator has not been participating (aside from voting), and ask that reddit remove their access rights....that would work. That would handle the issue of moderator, well, moderators like you.",hermithome,1408402470.0,Tue Aug 19 00:54:30 2014,8.0,mod,413070,0,7599.0,0.0

The difference being is where money needs to come from now. With music the money now should come from live performances and physical merchandise (like t-shirts or other fan paraphernalia), where with games it should come in the form of subscription fees and micro transactions. 

The whole piracy obsession comes from old school developers and producers that think charging for something that can be easily copied and distributed infinitely without degrading the product is still a viable option, which it is not, and the fact that the customers are finally getting wind of it.",Hammer2000,1299090009.0,Wed Mar  2 19:20:09 2011,3.0,no info,114934,0,,

8342,"Hi there Skitrel.

I am a sysadmin/dev and have my own server, but there is something you might be able to help everyone with...

I have the problem that there is no way to programmatically determine when a new server update is released, so I can't write a block of code to automatically update my server on each release.

If you have any sway with the devs, can you please ask them to enable the UpToDateCheck WebAPI for Starbound? This is just a field in Steam that they enable to track release versions. The result is that you can remotely check the version of every release via Steam's WebAPI.

For example, here's the UpToDateCheck URL for Team Fortress 2:
http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/UpToDateCheck/v1?appid=440&version=1&format=xml

For Starbound, the URL would be this, but it doesn't work because the devs have not enabled it:
http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/UpToDateCheck/v1?appid=211820&version=1&format=xml

Can you please bug someone about this?  Otherwise, how are you automatically updating the servers for your clients?",Es4Shp1EPhailaie,1393980083.0,Wed Mar  5 01:41:23 2014,1.0,no mod,114934,0,1.0,0.0

8490,"List of changes:

**= Shared Cells** 

- New room type: Dormitory 

- New furniture: Bunk Beds 

A Dormitory can house any number of prisoners, based on the number of beds installed Dormitories can be small eg 2x3, replacing the normal Cell, allowing for two or more inmates to share a cell together Or Dormitories can be large, with shared showers, toilets, phones, tvs, recreational facilities etc. Better facilities will result in a higher room grading, which will have a positive effect on your inmates 

**= Prisoner Intake (continued)** 

There are now several different modes of Intake that can be set for your prison Choose your mode from the Intake report 

•CLOSED No inmates will be brought to your prison 

•FILL CAPACITY Inmates will be brought into your prison when available, until your available capacity is full 

•TOTAL PRISONERS You set the total number of prisoners desired, and the Intake system works to fill that number 

•NUM PER DAY You choose the number of prisoners to bring in each day (The old method) 

•ALL All available prisoners will be brought in every day 

**= Escape mode (continued)** 

Escape mode was deemed too easy and unbalanced, and several features have been nerfed. 

•Damage done to a prison and its staff is now repaired automatically, once the player surrenders or is knocked out. 


•All staff killed are replaced with new hires 


•All fires are extinguished 


•Burnt down walls now get construction jobs created to replace them


•All ranged weapons now have limited ammo. Nb you can press G to drop the current weapon. 


•Shotgun : 6 shots 


•Pistol : 6 shots 


•Tazer : 1 shot 


•Assault rifle : 30 shots 


•If you steal an item from a room, there is now a three hour timer before that item can be stolen again from that room. This will put a stop to whole teams of escapees stealing knives from the kitchen. Nb these timers end instantly when the player surrenders or is knocked out. 


•Reputations rebalanced 


•Skilled fighter: chance to disarm opponent now reduced to 20% per hit, down from 30% 


•Extremely deadly: chance to kill reduced to 15% per hit, down from 30% 


•Ranged weapons are no longer made more powerfull by the Strong/Deadly reputations 


•Ranged weapons no longer disarm opponents when the attacker has the Skilled Fighter rep 


•Improved game over screen to stack up victims in the same way as the intake report's prisoner preview. 


•Gangs rebalanced Rebalanced the chances of gang members and leaders arriving, to make gangs a more likely occurance. 


•Doubled the chances of receiving gang members at intake 


•The chance of an incoming gang member being a leader is now much higher 


•The probability of receiving a gang leader also increases as the size of the gang increases. 


•New translations Greek, Romanian, Swedish, Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese 


**= BUG FIXES** 

- no more saving on escape mode gameover screen 

•Items still loaded on trucks dont get search jobs during shakedown 


•deployment menu has the correct default selected based on your research 


•fog of war turns on sooner on GABOS level

8546,">Communism is supposed to be a stateless society, so this makes no sense at all. Who makes up this shit? Socialism is not the same as communism, not by a far stretch.

Marx wrote this as the manifesto of the Communist League, a political party, during the German democratic revolution of 1848 (which eventually failed). Although Marx's eventual goal was a stateless society, unlike the anarchists he didn't believe that this was initially possible (this was a huge source of conflict during the early socialist movement). This organization was not necessarily pushing for a stateless society, though, and did have goals that involved using state power.

In Marxism, ""Communism"" has come to mean that eventual stateless society Marx wanted. However, in a historical sense, ""communist"" and ""socialist"" were both labels applied to the pro-workers movements. However, ""socialist"" was eventually chosen as the general label when the worker's movements started organizing again in the 1860's, because ""communist"" had religious connations in some countries (being the label of radical collectivist Christian movements). Marx was an important figure in this early socialist movement. 

After the Russian revolution, the Marxist-Leninists revived the name ""Communist"" to distinguish themselves from the Social Democrats. The radical socialists, who would eventually become communists, and the social democrats had actually, up until that point, been united movements, with some degree of cooperation and friction with the anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists.

And so, those were the principle lines socialism evolved into: anarchists, wanting an immediately stateless society (although, from the statements of anarchists, I really think ""localism"" would be a better description), Marxist-Leninists, pushing a totalitarian funhouse mirror version of Marx's vision, and democratic socialists, who moderated from their initially radical rhetoric and became content with merely pushing for alterations to the existing capitalist system.",watermark0n,1315250428.0,Mon Sep  5 21:20:28 2011,7.0,mod,413070,0,113.0,0.0

It's funny how some people can remain calm and perfectly reasonable under pressure and others, not so much. This guy obviously values his honor more than others. It makes me think of a study performed in the US between Northerners and Southerners. When a Northerner was insulted by a stranger, they were more likely to brush it off and move along, no spike in adrenaline occurred either. With the Southerners, a spike in adrenaline occurred and they were quickly brought to anger. They explained the difference in that Southerners have more of an honor culture and are more likely to feel defending their reputation was necessary, whereas Northerners didn't feel it was quite as important. Either way, the spike in adrenaline on the Southerner's part was involuntary. It was not something they could prevent.

8633,"For one thing, if all the wealth was spread out, we'd end up with something like $20 000.  
  
Really, the wealth would soon fall back into a fairly familiar order. Imagine the ferrari company finding the world in this situation. Suppose they sell a car at $800 000. now that's a big deal to everyone, because that's most of their new wealth spent on it. But Ferrari have to make them. Their employees might start deciding they can retire, as they are millionaires. So ferrari have to start offering higher wages to keep people who can make their cars. Some guys might figure ""If I can make $100 000 a year in my job, then I'll have $1 100 000, and I'll be even richer!""  
  
But they have to charge more for their cars now, as they are spending more to make them. Maybe they increase to price to $950 000, so people have to think hard about whether they want to lose almost all their new money getting a ferrari. So everyone is rich, but it still ends up difficult to get a ferrari.   
  
Worse, what if all the farmers decide they can retire too. They're all millionaires. They have to be persuaded to keep farming, so you have to offer them an amount of money that would make them want to keep producing wheat and things. That means bread is now incredibly expensive, and you have to use more of your million to pay for it.  
  
You also need to use more money to pay for everything else, for the same reason. It soon becomes apparent that if you want to persuade everyone to keep doing the jobs that provide you with water, power, fuel, emergency services and so on, you need to offer them more money or they won't bother any more.  
  
And just like that, having a million dollars isn't that great any more. It can't set you up for life, so you have to keep working, but you need to demand enough money to live. So you have to be paid more too.  
  
And the people who have lots of people working for them, or run companies that sell things to lots of people, get lots of shares of the millions that are going around. They end up getting richer again.  
  
And pretty soon you end up with the same situation as you had in the first place.",3226,1413162805.0,Mon Oct 13 03:13:25 2014,22.0,no mod,"419,772",1,13079.0,0.0

Nah just kidding. Better links to mooch would be helpful.

And something I’ve been tossing around for a while in my head is how it could be useful to have a stickied thread for good and affordable setups for beginners. I see so many people on here who are new to vaping asking what setup is best. Maybe having a stickied thread updated monthly if needed could be an easier place for newcomers to look and get feedback. Also I know u/anthony_vapes has posted many times links to his best of lists. And seeing as he’s so active on here and a great wealth of knowledge that could be helpful to add links for with his permission of course.

8865,"Oh absolutely yes.  The average American has a net worth somewhere in the neighborhood of -$10k.  The consumer credit industry owns the general public.

And if you 'do the smart thing' and stay away from credit cards?  It will destroy your 'credit rating' and you'll not be able to get money for any significant purchases like home mortgages or car purchases.  

And saving money to be able to purchase a home outright?  Positively ludicrous idea.  Since 1980, the average worker salary in the US rose by 1%.  ONE.  Average worker productivity in that same time period rose a hundred-fold.  Every penny of that improved productivity was skimmed off and delivered to the upper upper class, under the presumption that it would trickle down.  Those upper class folks were supposed to use that money to create more jobs, expand their businesses, etc.  They didn't do that.  They gave it to other upper upper class guys in the financial services sector, who specialized in extracting money from the lower classes and delivering it to the upper upper class.

8983,"Is [this](http://i.imgur.com/29Mth8r.jpg) what you're looking for?

Outgoing oneway streets will *never* cause traffic lights on the road they're outgoing from (which is a really efficient way to distribute traffic in general). In this manner you can split your main road 1+4+1 / 2+2+2 / 4+2 depending on what exactly you're looking for.

If you want a twoway overpass it gets a bit awkward since now your sixlane is split into 3 incoming and 1+1+1 if you stick to what I posted above.

edit: I think I understood your initial picture now. [This](http://i.imgur.com/eA8WdlY.jpg) is the closest I can think of.

9081,"In the real world we craft things we need, we might not have perfected our technique within the first couple of tries, but after hundreds of hours of constantly making a piece of crap that serves no purpose only to be broken down and reassembled into another piece of crap you'd think we'd learn *something*, like how to make a weapon deadly, brutal, and fierce/self preserved, but nooooo.


I wish weapons, specifically talents, were more modular, and can be stripped from one weapon and *permenantly* placed on a crafted one, but only if the weapon you're stripping was originally *dropped* (not crafted). Even if this method diminished the potency of talents, (e.g. ilvl31 brutal=24% dropped, but 18% stripped/reapplied) It would make finding HE loot more exciting, even if it rolled poorly, while at the same time it would also make crafting feel less like a slot machine. 

Division tech requirements for such a system would make sense, there's a finite number of it before your secondary and primary have all 3 talents that you want, but there's always the possibility a crafting or looting upgrades with those talents rolled naturally, or even 2/3 with the third being a solid alternative. 


Stupid idea probably, but so was making Division Tech and box farming a thing. 


My point is; our agents should become more adept at things we do all the time, passive bonuses that apply to things like opening containers, interacting with distressed citizens, and crafting weapons, gear, & attachments.

Thanks for the map, your route is a bit different than mine as I start on the west side of dz06, only time I engage in combat is at the pit, and only if there's a shotgunner on my ass. Just run, pick, rinse repeat. 25 boxes in 12 minutes. 15min if you count getting a fresh DZ. I usually average 3-4 HE DT per run, but lately as more and more people have been hitting rank 50 I've pretty much given up on farming it and opted for RC glitch farming, which is slightly more fun than box farming sim 2016, but arguably less lucrative.


Many of my friends have recently hit dzr50 and have stopped playing, it's sad that DT is a major part of why people get turned off to this game when it has so much more to offer, like the same 4 challenge mode missions, and a new glitch every ~~week~~ day.",Nobeus,1459425217.0,Thu Mar 31 13:53:37 2016,1.0,no mod,"419,772",1,51.0,0.0

Sudden massive headache? Go to the doc.

My thought is, maybe the game isn't intended to be played how you are playing it. Rushing through and pushing HE farm. Maybe you're supposed to just go around and kill mobs in the dark zone. When they drop DT, they drop it. When you find a chest that's active, you get DT. Seems to me like the problem is people pushing to get items faster than is intended.

9164,">that racism should be revealed to the public in order to weaken it

That's my main argument for having total freedom of speech. I think fascism is fascism's biggest enemy.

>I am not going to accept a racism-fasism oriented subreddit though and I will have to resign

Let's say that tomorrow golden dawn supporters flood this subreddit. And they start posting articles that support their ideology. As long as the article is not factually incorrect, even if i disagree with their rhetoric i wouldnt delete that submission. If the article is factually incorrect, states for example ""99% of crime is committed by pakistanis"", i would flag it as misleading. But if the article says ""according to the official police data, 30% of the crime is commited by pakistanis"" and the actual police data verify that claim, that i would leave the submission as is.

Why? Because it would set a precedent. What if tomorrow you have a moderator who is a supporter of golden dawn and deletes submissions which are against his ideology? I dont think it is the job of a moderator to define the content of this subreddit by deleting submissions. If you disagree with something, you can always make your case in the comments.

But there is the case of hate speech. What if a submission say ""let's gather up at that place and  beat up some immigrants""? Well, i can see myself deleting that post but unfortunately most cases wont be a clear cut like that. What if a submission say ""Come join the Golden Dawn protest"", should a moderator delete that submission? IMO, no he shouldnt. But what if the word ""protest"" becomes a code word for ""beating up"" immigrants? These things can become hard and complicated, let's hope we never reach that state.

It is important to maintain a neutral position, even though the vast majority of this subreddit is  antifascist. Exactly because we are part of the majority we should try to be as neutral as possible. Fascism is just a symptom. It is caused by lack of education in combination with frustration/fear/anger. And it satisfies the most basic instincts of human nature. It gives an immediate response. When people are in the situation that we are now, they just want shit to get done, even if it is the wrong shit. They want immediate action. They want to blame someone. And Golden Dawn gives them what they want.

Want to fight fascism? Educate people and show exactly what fascism does. Which is why i am ""happy"" that Golden Dawn does whatever it does.

I've had experience from greek online communities in games or just forums and it usually turns sour fast.


So, please be carefull in selecting someone who is unlikely to pick a side over the other, who is unlikely to overly represent some element over another. and there's also the question of who is this subreddit for, and the balance between greeks and foreigners.

He recieved a heart but during the operation, suffered 2 strokes. His speech was affected from then on, and a year later he started getting worse. We found out it was frontal temporal dementia (Pick's Disease), and possibly the early onset of Alzheimer's disease. He lived 5 years after that. His mother had Alzheimer's and when he was diagnosed, he always told us he wanted to die and not put us through what he and my mother went through with his mother. We live in the US and there's no sight of something like this being allowed in the far future. 

I just wanted to say that this video both saddened me (as it did to all), but also for whatever reason, makes me smile because I know some people won't have to go through what we did. My father died 4 days after his 60th birthday, unable to stand, speak, move, eat for himself. He told us he wanted to die, and we did nothing. I felt like we forced him to stay tortured till his last day. 

Honestly I wanted to say more but I'm at a loss for words. I guess just share this as much as possible, hopefully good will come of it.",None,1348846783.0,Fri Sep 28 17:39:43 2012,1.0,none,"419,772",1,,

9429,"Hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism or any other thyroid issues are usually ignored not only by patients but also by doctors.  Hypothyroidism has around 300 symptoms that seem so small that people don't think of them being a symptom or assume that's just the way their body is.  Some of these can be weight issue, memory problems, anxiety, depression, muscle pain to just name a few.  Due to the thyroid being a very important gland as it affects a lot of functions in the body, it should be something that gets checked out.

Though there seems to be a link between untreated hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer.  

Another symptom that should be checked is swollen lymph nodes as it shows a sign that something is wrong like an infection or cancer.  I'm finding out that the lymph node on my neck that's been there since I was 10 years old was most likely a sign that I had cancer, because while being treated for cancer 18 years later, it's now shrinking for the first time.  Due to my doctor just claiming it was nothing and probably from a cat scratch (it's not as I now know that the lymph nodes that would have swollen from that has to be from the same area the scratch was at... my cat never scratched me on my neck), I have been possibly living with cancer for 18 years.",ChibiSubaru,1367790499.0,Sun May  5 23:48:19 2013,4.0,no mod,"419,772",1,163.0,0.0

I don't know why, I just trust reddit users' opinions on things over marketed websites and their 'user reviews', and I love the conversations on here, and people on here really describing flavors, like a bi-weekly review of all the top things some of us might have missed through the work periods we go through would be very useful for some of us, I don't know, just my 2cents. I'd also like to see less political views on our demographic here, I've done this in the past and in hindsight, I can't really say I disagree with kids vaping, just vaping nicotine product that young is my only concern but (this is where the problem is, where the main debate starts) it has its health risks none the less on underdeveloped bodies. So, I'd like to honestly see a rule where that is defined so we can't really make negative posts, because it causes problems and we're all here to indulge in new ideas, reviews, and flavor, or tank recommendations + Mods.

9521,"Ignore the downvotes, if people can't be bothered commenting, that sort of thing shouldn't count - Reddit is rife with that sort of thing.

As for the question. The game is meant to be fun. I have driven in that view for quite a while now, since DiRT 2 to be exact and have loved it. That said, I found it was difficult in DC after the weather patch so I switched to bonnet view if it was going to be a night race in the rain or snow. It's no biggie, as I enjoy the game immensely, so I adapted my approach.

I still race from the interior view and even got all three stars in the F50 event recently in Norway, despite rain accrual blocking my view of the upcoming corner. I don't think the wiper speed would have helped much with that car anyway.

like I say, it's meant to be fun, so treat accordingly - there is no crime in running a race from a different view once in a while, or indeed however often you want to.",MeanElf,1435972419.0,Sat Jul  4 03:13:39 2015,0.0,no mod,"419,772",1,1.0,0.0

I am there now and I am having an absolute blast.  The game lived up to all of my expectations and the shooting and movement mechanics were better than I hoped for.  Co-op works fairly seamlessly, matchmaking works fine, and the Dark Zone is a blast.

The Division got right everything Destiny got wrong.  I think I am about 80 hours in and I have had so much fun.  Money well spent.  Moreover, have you ever thought about taking a break and playing another game?  I jump back and forth between games.  I usually have at least two or three games going that I bounce between.  Keeps things fresh.

9654,"UK based doctor. I think that most people these days are pretty savvy and often when anything changes, usually tend to come and ask about it. It's often the much older patients who ignore things and put off seeking help at times.

I guess in general- in answer to the question of things that people think of as less of a big deal:

1) older women (over 50-60s) with abdominal bloating. If this is new and persistent, some women assume that this is just constipation or just putting on weight with age, but sometimes this can be a symptom of ovarian cancer

2) in fact older people with changes in bowel habit- ie becoming more constipated or loose. Saying that- one thing that older people do get to be quite preoccupied about is their bowel habit! Some older guys seem to really look forward to pooptime of the day!

3) A useful symptom that people dont often mention- say when they have a gallstone- is called steatorrhoea. When you dont absorb fats as well as you would do normally, and so your poopy comes out all fatty, making it smelly, yellow and difficult to flush! You'd be surprised at the number of people who say they dont look at their poo when they've done it, but its a useful symptom to mention.

4) Moles and skin changes. WHITE PEOPLE!! Get those checked out. Once my GF who is a GP was seeing this young patient (I think she was in her late teens/early twenties) and she'd come in for a mild cough, and as she was listening to her chest and back, noticed a suspicious looking mole on her back that later turned out to be melanoma (and was successfully removed without complication). The girl had noticed it and just ignored it. Because I dont want this to be scaremongering- please check this link if you are worried and see your doctor!
And please stop sunbeds please!
http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Cancer-of-the-Skin-Melanoma.htm

5) Young women- bleeding after sex. This is not always normal - please get a smear test. 

6) Back pain that wakes you from sleep. Is high up in your back. persists. In particular- I am referring to a list of factors called ""Red flag"" symptoms. http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/spinal-disc-problems-including-red-flag-signs

I want my takehome message to be less faecally related and more along the lines of- if there is something different- seek an opinion on it. I have provided links to reduce anxiety, but that is NO SUBSTITUTE for an actual medical opinion. Thanks

9668,"I would sincerely agree, here. All gamers at one time or another have participated in ""piracy"" of some type. Copying game files onto 3.5"" floppies, burning copies of discs and distributing the serial, using P2P or torrents. Then, services like Steam and GOG.com came along and made it easy and affordable to own games.

Steam sales are the main reason why I have *so* many games now. Before, I would have at any given time ~15 games on hand. Now, I have over 140. And it's *cheap*, dammit! Buying an entire game for less than $10? Sign me up.

It makes it worth it, in the end, to go with the digital distribution model. You make more money because you can move more units and spend less money in physical copies of the games. Plus, developers get a deeper cut because there's a higher profit margin per unit ""shipped"".

9675,"I will never understand why evangelicals give so much money to Israel and keep lobbying for it in congress when the Israeli state not only doesn't give a shit about Christians, it actively oppresses them. 
Something like 10% of the Palestinian population is Christian. Certainly not a majority, but it's a significant enough minority that they deserve recognition. 

I'm not going to get into who's right or wrong when it comes to Israel. Fact of the matter, Israel exists and it's not going anywhere. But no matter what way you spin it, the Israeli government treats non-Jews like shit. It doesn't want them in Israel, it doesn't want them in the occupied territories, and if it could get away with it it wouldn't even want them visiting the country. This is what ""Jewish state"" means. A state for Jews and Jews alone. 
So yes, if you are a non-Jew in Israel, the Israeli government's policy is essentially to make your life so difficult that you pack up and leave. Cheryl Rubenberg wrote a book called The Palestinians. It's about what the title says, but I reccomend you read it. She puts a number of lengthy quotations from senior Israeli political and military leaders. The gist of it all is basically what I just typed. 

Christians of America, these people don't give a shit about your brothers in the west bank and Gaza, and they are using you. They know it, too. 
These are people who will tear down the homes of Palestinian Christians to make way for a new Jewish settlement, and then turn around and ask you for more money. And for some insane reason you people will give it to them. 
Why people in this country think we should have anything to do with this nation is insane to me. 
I don't hate the Israeli people by any means. But it's government breaks international law on a daily basis. You'd have to be an amoral maniac to support any of it's government's policies. 
I am not exageratting when I say these people are not only insane, but racist and bigoted as well.

Unfortunately that model is impossible because to my knowledge reddit doesn't keep a public log of all mod-actions taken within a subreddit.

        author: 'Bob',
        title: 'This is a <em>Title<em>:<br/>How's it going?'

    ]

I am rendering these items in a `<SectionList>` and of course, inside a `<Text>`, it won't render correctly.

Some research led me to [https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview) which led me to more questions:

1. Is it completely insane/wrong to render these tiny snippets of text in a bunch of separate `<WebView>` components nested in a SectionList? (Somehow it feels wrong)
2. As WebView was removed from core, this library only works if I eject from Expo. Is this really the only solution then? We can't alter the JSON response on the server-side as some of the HTML is crafted specifically.",wafflwaffl,1552666932.0,Fri Mar 15 17:22:12 2019,1.0,no mod,2278,0,109.0,0.0

Due to the ever-increasing costs to develop a game, publishers need to push more units just to maintain profitability, while pushing big-budget to make the games have mass-market appeal (ooh, shiny) and then making it built for the lowest common denominator to help push 5+MM units sold.

For every Inception or The Dark Knight that comes out, you have 10 The Expendables (no clue if it's actually good or not, it just -appears- to be a mass-market ""popcorn"" movie).  This causes the games to degrade in quality and just fade into obscurity quickly.  Or you run into sequel syndrome with, for instance, Activision and the CoD/GH franchise.  It's made worse with once a year sequels.

It's not to say this method is bad, or that these games can't be enjoyable.  It's just, if you don't already like the medium or love the playstyle they represent, they get very dull, very fast.

The same as their US counterparts being DC/Langley based.

All MSM output is propaganda. The ability to read between the lines is the ability to see the truth.

These journalists are not corrupt per se. Individually, they believe that they're reporting the truth.        
But each and every one is employed and then prospers because their natural instinct is to support the overall line of propaganda. Those who run against the grain find their careers (and income) cut short.

10025,"Grinding mobs will almost certainly be faster than questing no matter how you go about it, however, if you're not doing quests you're missing out on contribution points, which are a currency used to 'rent' things like production houses, trading nodes, gear, medalions(for blackstones), farms, and a few other things. 

My opinion, if you want to save yourself some of the headache that comes with translating, is to only show combat quests. You can do this by 'unchecking' the options at the top-right of your quest log. The buttons are: two crossed swords, a pickaxe, a fish, an ellipse (...), and a trade symbol. If its not obvious, these buttons represent combat quests, gathering/production quests, fishing quests, ""talking/other"" quests, and trading/exploration quests.

So the simplest way to level while still gaining contribution points is to only show combat quests. You might also want to show (...) so you can get bread crumb quests that lead you to other quest hubs/towns/cities. Just stick to those and try not to do any of the confusing ones. When you're ready to really get into questing at a higher level, you can use http://black.inven.co.kr/dataninfo/quest/ to translate the non-combat quests into broken English and help you out. (This doesn't apply to Media, as the website hasn't updated for that kingdom, yet.) You may also want to start learning how to translate Hangul into English. I was afraid of it at first, but I type as easily in Hangul as I do in English and it helps a TON in every aspect of this game.",AtuanReddit,1424733325.0,Tue Feb 24 00:15:25 2015,3.0,no mod,"419,772",1,24.0,0.0

10039,I read an article years ago in the Economist which criticised the US for having elected judges because you end up with a ratchet effect with only judges who promise stricter sentences getting elected and inevitably the number of prisoners keeps rising. Also the people who are likely to vote are those who want tougher action on crime whereas those who aren't as bothered won't - this will skew the results of the election. Obviously there's a difference between police commissioners and judges (they don't have power over sentences) but I fear tabloidy figures who come out populist stuff rather than pragmatic solutions get elected.,CannibalHolocaust,1349560112.0,Sat Oct  6 23:48:32 2012,11.0,no mod,114934,0,544.0,0.0

(How do I pull out my rifle if I cant see the damn thing? Wheres the steering wheel for this vehicle? There's no peripheral for this object I'll have to pull out my mouse and keyboard! Where is my damn mouse and keyboard?!)

It dawned on me that once hand and body tracking are implemented that game developers will take the controllers and interfaces out of our hands and put them into the game. Sure, you won't get the tactile feedback but think about the limitless potential to interact with your environment without being held down by a single interface.

10043,"It happens in every form of media that has ever been created.  TV, movies, music, games, comics, even news sources.  The main thing you have to keep in mind is that the ultimate goal is to reach the highest level of potential.  An indie artist is going to want to get signed to a major label, just like a no name game developer wants to be affiliated with a major gaming company.  

It starts with having an idea or a stroke of creative genius.  You discover that you have talent or ability, and other people can benefit from this.  Then you need to create and market said idea.  This takes lots of money.  Obviously the more money you put into it, the better quality it will be, as well the more people it will reach on the marketing aspect of it.  So someone who is loaded will never need a music label, or a mainstream gaming company because they can create, market, and release whatever they want themselves.

If you are not loaded however, as a majority of starting musicians, game designers, actors, etc. are, then you have to align yourself with someone who will back you financially to make money off of your accomplishments in the future.  Unfortunately this is the step in which you relinquish a percentage of you creative control.

This is the vicious cycle that occurs when trying to market creativity.  There will always be douchebags who produce shit, just because they know it will sell, but if you truly enjoy what you do, it's a disservice to your fans to not spread your creativity to as many people as possible.  And the only way to do that is with money.

Edit: I realized I didn't answer the question at all in my rambling.  Small gaming companies want to become big gaming companies, just like indie labels want to be major labels, public access wants to be cable, etc.  They take advantage of an artists lack of money to step in and ""take control"" so to speak.  Their goal is to find the next big thing that will skyrocket them from small to major.  So, small developers who release ""true innovation"" are only doing that in hopes that they can one day become a major developer that releases crap, just because they know it will sell.

MOTD:

Line 1: __________**Hosted by multiplay servers!**

Line 2: **This Servers Unique ID is XXXXX. Search and favorite!**

Line 3: **Enjoy your stay! Report host related issues to Multiplay**

Line 4: /""Insert server specific custom MOTD here""\

Line 5: /""Insert server specific custom MOTD here""\

Etc...

_ == whitespace character.

X == UID number


Each server should have a Unique ID displayed in the MOTD played every 10 minutes such that players can search the ID which will be nested in the server name and find the server again. 

Example server name: **DayZ 115027 FRAGZ_KLAN (Multiplay.11843)**


Servers should restart at the 13:30 point and play through untill 19:00 such that the map becomes dark, but not so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face (when you'd be realistically sleeping/cowering, not out hunting for loot.) Server owners should have the option to also choose a 3 hour reset cycle which would start at 14:30 and end at 17:00 for sunset mode, start at 10:00 and end at 13:00 for daytime mode, or start at 17:00 and end at 20:00 for night-time mode. The 3 hour restarts are to accommodate loot spawn, and the 6 hour restarts are to accommodate atmosphere.  If you could create a script which restarts the server after more than an hour at peak traffic, that would be FANTASTIC because that not only facilitates fresh loot, but reduces lag (at least for now, because alpher.)


Perhaps a system should be put in place to report/pursue servers which advocate cheating. I cannot currently think of a method which doesn't consume vast amounts of staff resource or restrict players heavily, though if I think of one I will post it here.


That's it for now. If you take anything to heart, please, the formatted MOTDs. If a majority of the servers started forcing identifiers in the name we could find servers much more easily. Rather than ""Uhh, add me on steam and join me."" we could say ""I'm in Multiplay 132."" or ""Favorite Multiplay 132, That's where I'm going to set up all of my backpack dead drops.""",ph1294,1393609295.0,Fri Feb 28 18:41:35 2014,4.0,no mod,114934,0,632.0,0.0

I've always believed karma is the worst thing about reddit since it enforces groupthink posting and hivemind discussion (even more so now as the popularity of reddit increases), the majority of people I would hazard like the little numbers going up in their profiles. Instead of posting good discussion (once upon a time - now only the smallest reddits can do this) and content that would not garner as much attention the choice to easy karma is to throw up an imgur link of rage/cat/my girlfriend/motivation/etc or a pun/joke/meme comment.  This behaviour only damages reddit's ability to be interesting overall in big subreddits but certainly also filters down into practically everything smaller unless mods ban it.

Conversely r-politics pretends to be a neutral sub for political debate, but in reality it is a leftist echo chamber that only exists to spew bile at President Trump and routinely bans conservative viewpoints - same with r/news, r/worldnews, r/politicalhumor and many others. 

I fully expect the censorship from the left to get much worse as we approach the next election as we know from history that leftist ideas can only flourish in a climate of censorship. 

It won't matter - President Trump will be re-elected again in 2020 and lefties will wail and stamp their feet like a child having a tantrum for 4 more years.

With recent updated to starbound that support mod packing, I think that'll be easier - but I had hoped for something as simple as the ability to upload a zip file and have the server unpack it, or delete a directory without having to do it via ftp (ftp uploading or deleting thousands of tiny text files separately is horrible).

Its kind of strange letting people into your place (and knowing the combo to the lock) but I have had 99% good experiences and the only bad one was when the guy clearly did not walk the dog even 1/4 as far as the other walkers (the app has GPS so you can see the route). I demanded my money back and they gave it to me. The current cost for walks is not really a sustainable business model (I'm guessing tiny margins) and I think they will try to raise prices eventually. They have also just recently made some changes to the UI which make it cumbersome and difficult to cancel a walk even if no walker is assigned for hours.

First, she talks about pulling him off the basketball team in part because it would be unfair to other boys ""in his condition"", but there's nothing stopping other gay boys on the team from lusting after the straight boys who remain, and she doesn't say she called for the team to be disbanded. It's inconsistent.

Then she says she took his door off because ""privacy would just tempt him to experiment in the ways teen boys tend to do"", but jacking off has nothing to do with being gay--a fact she explicitly acknowledges--and she didn't take her straight sons' doors off to prevent masturbation. One might argue that she's simply ignorant and believes homosexuality comes with a greater propensity to masturbation, but she's already demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of homosexuality in that she recognizes that sexual orientation isn't a choice. That's not completely damning by itself, but she just keeps going.

>Since romantic relationships can never be a part of his life, we also forbid him from dating (girls, obviously)

This makes no sense. If she believed homosexuality were a choice, she would be *encouraging* him to date girls. If she believed it weren't, she wouldn't even think to prohibit him from dating girls.

>we never allowed him to have a cell phone, since he might use it to access inappropriate and confusing images.

This is especially nonsensical. It's entirely possible that she was technically illiterate enough not to know that there are feature phones that don't access the internet, even with WiFi, and that carriers can't block MMS. What I cannot believe is that the son didn't know this and never griped to his friends at school about not having a phone long enough for someone to tell him about the cheapest kind of phone out there. It is 2015. The idea that a 17-year-old is going to let a nonsensical reason like that get in between him and begging for a basic phone for texting is inconceivable. Maybe it would make more sense if she also said she couldn't afford a cell phone or was afraid he would run up the bill or didn't believe in cell phones or was afraid of him getting dirty texts, but that's not what she said. She said *images.*

She just goes on and on making those same kinds of mistakes. It's as if someone sat down and thought: *what can I say to piss off a bunch of people.*",goatcoat,1438355504.0,Fri Jul 31 17:11:44 2015,0.0,mod,"1,398,796",1,1390.0,1.0

Any doesn't any of the so called farmers looked experienced? The animal at 1:55, why are they letting the animal move? To think that millions of this type of shit is happening, you'd think they'd be more experienced.

>The State Forestry Administration (SFA) is set to offer training courses for fur farmers.[31] Legislation was drafted in September 2009 to address any cruelty to animals in China. If passed, the legislation would regulate how farm animals are raised, transported and slaughtered.[32] In 2005, animals right group The Swiss Animal Protection accused the Chinese of skinning fur-bearing animals including the Asiatic raccoon while still alive, and produced a controversial video on the subject.[33][34] The fur industry in Europe was shocked and requested the original unedited footage, the Swiss animal rights group refused to supply the unedited footage, fueling more speculation that the footage was staged. The China Fur Commission and China Leather Industry Association also challenged the authenticity of the video, stating: ""Pictures showing animals being skinned alive are obviously plotted. All those with common sense would not choose this slaughter method to attain fur.""[35] The government of Suning County, Hebei Province also issued a statement outlining welfare practices on its fur farms, calling the alleged practice of skinning animals alive ""unimaginable"", and urging Swiss Animal Protection Organization to ""respect the truth"".

Honestly, even from a economic stand point, skinning a animal alive doesn't make sense. The potential to actually ruining the fur.

If any of you actually do some research on this, you can see why this is bull shit. The segment about Cats and Dogs. Most first world countries already banned the import of Cats and Dogs furs.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_farming

China isn't even the biggest supplier. They take in supplies for manufacturing and re-export the product.

I don't know why PETA staged this video when China isn't even the largest supplier.

Also Olivia Munn didn't expose shit. And PETA is retarded as ever.

You cannot find any other information on such practices because it's staged by PETA.

Demolishing homes, tearing down solar panels, uprooting olive trees, confiscating water wells, blockades, etc. are all used as a means to do this. 

You will notice that when a story about an attack by Palestinians is on reddit, the zionists are all over the comments stating how they are all terrorists and want to kill all jews and israel has a right to protect themselves (without ever going into the reasoning behind why attacks like that occur) but they are uncommonly quiet when you hear a story like this.

10607,"> I can tell you guys that our impressions have increased roughly 20% during the test period. I believe (though am not certain as it's merely an observation) that number of comments also increased.

And where's your control?  What was the increase in impressions the week before the test, and what will it be the next week, two weeks, etc.?  That will be important.

As far as an increase in comments, I think that might be similar to my experience.  The thing is most people don't read comments rated 0 or below.  With invisible karma, they did.  Also, when I reach such a comment elsewhere, I'll be far less likely to actually respond to it, because no one will see the comment; it would be a waste of time.

10685,"In February earlier this year my girlfriend suggested we see the Watts Towers while we were on vacation out in LA. I had never heard of it before, or seen it, but it looked cool enough and it was a beautiful sunny day.

My friend who had just moved out to LA, offered to give us a ride from Santa Monica. He commented while we were driving ""I've never been down this way...""

Sure enough, it starts to look a little less fabulous; there's liquor stores, run down houses, and I start to see street signs that sound familiar. 

""Alameda, Rosecrans..."" I say to myself, ""Kendrick raps about these streets.""

When we get there, the area looks pretty bad, but we see the Watts towers and there's a community center right next to it. We take the tour (recommended, btw), and watch a video on Simon Rodia. Interesting, awesome stuff. All the while I'm still oblivious to where we are.

We go to leave, and at this point my buddy is off doing something and can't pick us up. I pull up Google Maps, and zoom out from our location.  

""Compton"" shows up on the map. 

I turn to my girlfriend and tell her ""Kelly, we're going straight to the train, walk fast with me.""

I've never walked that fast before in my life. Felt lucky that I didn't wear red or blue by accident.

10737,"Hugs is an interesting beast.

On the admin team, we've been discussing for some time now the nature of play on the server. What the server was like when it started, what it became, and what it's like today.

Some of our discussions have even become quite heated. Some think the server is the worst it has ever been, some think it's always been this way and that the admins are simply less tolerant of poor play because of the huge amount of experience some of us have.

In reality, both of these are probably correct.

Either way, we're going to be changing things, aiming to bring a better server to you guys again.

***

**Changes on the server**

**Killcam**

It's going away again. The lack of it always promoted a more competitive atmosphere, and we'd like to point hugs towards that again rather than the direction of more casual public play that the server has become. We've also theorised that it will deter many of the pub players from sticking around.

**Teabagging**

Without killcam, this is going to stop. Once upon a time we kicked for teabagging, it's not conducive to a friendly atmosphere. We've let that slide as the clubhouse has become more and more tightknit, we're taking that away. Don't do it anymore, we're going to start regarding it as ""general dickery"" again.

**Being useless**

This isn't acceptable any more. There are many many things that fall under the banner of being useless.

Sitting on a mountain sniping

Driving around useless robots

Attempting to run people over with mavs (as opposed to using a mav properly to spot and communicate with the team enemy activity from altitude)

By no means is this an exhaustive list. Don't be useless.

**Communicate**

Insert missive about new mic policies.

***

**In addition to these changes. Let's talk about SKILL.**

Skill is a difficult beast to quantify, in short we want to improve it.

Over the next several days, expect many many posts regarding skill. Consider this a Battlefield university, newbies, you need to listen up and listen well. There's going to be a ton of content teaching you how to be better players.

On this point - stop frustrating the oldies by being, well, bad. We want to help you **not** be bad any more. Help us help you by consuming the content you're going to see - even better, start posting in the subreddit. Ask us questions, the experienced players LOVE spouting off all their knowledge.

***

**What you'll see change in us**

**Raging**

You won't see this any more. Everyone promises, even when frustrated admins won't be publicly venting again.

However, do the team a favour and try to take on board the things said here. These all contribute to the frustration that occasionally exasperates the team and old-regulars alike.

**More professional behaviour**

This extends not only to the server, but to this subreddit. You won't see circlejerks of reaction gifs any more for example.

***

In short, to tl;dr this post - We want you the players to become tryhards. Lovable lovable tryhards. And in general, we want to make the community and the admin team as a whole a more professional and mature atmosphere, like it has been in the past.",Skitrel,1371155513.0,Thu Jun 13 22:31:53 2013,1.0,mod,114934,0,5749.0,0.0

If you wish to live in isolation from other members of your species, than do so against nature's optimal configuration for people. To live without compromise would be the most hilarious reproductive strategy. Good luck cooperating with a member of the opposite sex for the well-being if your offspring. Because then you would compromise, no matter how **biologically** rewarding raising a child can be, with your prerogatives and goals. You now have to be concerned with an entity outside if yourself, fundamentally compromising your **choices**.

Your argument is not valid because it is nonsense. Without adding any personal interpretation of the thoughts of another you detract from the existence of humanity.

10780,"Hmmm. Looks like a tool that ""makes"" its own key since it quickly works on the ignition lock after unlocking the door.

 Notice when he makes the final turn of the device in the door lock (showing that the device has the correct key teeth configuration) he tightens the butt of the device which I assume locks the movable key teeth (on the device) in place so it basically turns the device into a key that can be used over and over (until the butt cap is loosened and the mechanics inside reset or fall out of place)

Also, about those numbers. The main difference is that 7DTD has an official forum, H1Z1 so far don't and this subreddit is the closest thing to it.

10823,"> am quite aware of what goes on in SRS. You don't need to condescendingly simplify it, but I have no doubt that's what you think you need to do anyway because you interpret any disagreement as misunderstanding.

I do need to simplify it, not just for you but for other readers that may wish to join in as well, I'd rather not waste my time replying to them later on but instead list out rather simple things.

If you find it condescending, I'm apologize but that's mostly not on purpose.  Mostly ;)

>Both the ideology, and presentation of the ideology, are as extreme as it is untenable, from the grand views of society as patriarchy applying to everyday bus rides to the idea that something like calling someone hot qualifies as misogyny or oppression.

Your denial of patriarchy having affects on bus rides is essentially a denial patriarchy exists in whole, if something has large effects on our society of course it will have effects on small interactions.  As for calling someone hot, I think you are talking about walking up to strangers and telling someone they are hot.  The idea behind doing something like this is that this person ""pleases your penis"" and you are introducing yourself on the basis that this is the persons worth to you.  I think we can both agree sexual attraction plays a part in relationships but the objectification in the beginning probably is a good indicator that there will be even more objectification later on.  Keep in mind this isn't an exhaustive list of the issues with the above statement, just one of the larger ones.

>Anyone who clicks SRSMicroaggressions or SRSWomen can sample, in unfiltered and non-circlejerk form, the legitimate and sincere beliefs of SRS; they are no less insane than the implied beliefs that one would get reading the circlejerk.

I can't speak for SRSWomen, I don't view or post there.  SRSMicroaggressions has a very specific purpose, it's a place to vent when those little shitty things that happen in life happen.  SRSSucks has targeted this sub especially for this reason, it's a safe place where people can talk about Microaggressions without being told ""LOL, THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL"" and people can comfort them, it says it right there on the sidebar but for some reason SRSSUcks has taken it upon itself to link to just about every post ([And downvote brigade](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMicroaggressions/comments/11tm9y/female_and_male_connectors/))as if SRSMicroaggressions is saying ""My bus ride was worse then the holocaust"".

>Introducing the idea of multisourcing doesn't help your position that Chen actually vetted his sources. The places that typically agree with SRS on the internet are radical feminist blogs not known for intellectual rigor or even intellectual honesty.

I fail to see how multisourcing does a disservice to my position.  If a feminist talks about a moderate feminist idea or that a rape joke is shitty of course a radical feminist will agree with them, the difference is they may disagree on the causes and solutions to each.  I fail to see how this agreement on opinions has an affect on facts which are what is sourced.  It is a fact that VA made /r/rape it is an opinion on what people believe his reasoning for doing so could be.  

I think this may be a problem we are having in our discussion, can we agree facts are sourced, opinions are cited?

>SRS is the originator of most of the reddit-specific issues Chen reports on...

**[citation needed]**

>[words]..and completely ignores how absurd it is to use SRS as a ""vetted"" source...

Here you are coming back and saying that practically anything SRS says is to be considered untrue by default.  Did I mention the sky is blue?

> Not only is this is giving Chen way too much credit

This is if you start from the assumption that Chen doesn't deserve credit, fact checking his article it appears his credibility isn't in question but that's my opinion and I'm sure you can tell my biases.

>it's impractical

The real tree is really close to the parking lot, but the forest service pulled up its market a few years ago to prevent vandals/ignoramuses from fucking it up.

The tree claimed to be older than methusela has not been confirmed, because they lost the core samples in the 80's.

As another poster noted, the pictures of cute animals serve to act as a counterpoint for some of the darker content which appears here in many forms. It serves a genuine purpose, actually helping people struggling with depression and producing positive frames of mind.

I am no friend of karma whoring; were I to be ruler of Reddit this land would buckle beneath the force of my iron fist. And I would be very busy for very long before my attention ever turned to the whores of /aww. /r/aww is full of original content. It may lack depth, but at least it's people taking new pictures and sharing them. So much of this site is people reposting shit that's been here a million times before because they know it'll get upvoted, and THAT is the real problem with karma whoring; anything new must compete with thousands of tried-and-trued posts which are often upvoted by people who actually know they're reposts, but upvote them because they know they like that thing.

I suppose you didn't read the AMA by the guy who had to sort through child porn all day for the FBI (think it was the FBI); he said that /r/aww helped to keep him sane.

You think that /r/aww is what makes Reddit look bad. Really now. Not the rape apologists? Not the racists? Not the misogynists? The cute animals. They don't even use lolspeak captions. It's pics of cute animals. If they do nothing for you, you unsubscribe, and you don't click the links in the last section of /r/tldr, which as you failed to acknowledge, *have been there all along*.

I've been unsubscribed from /r/aww for most of the time since I created my account, but I recently resubscribed because I needed cheering up.

I don't know why I bothered to form such a comprehensive answer to someone too far gone to realise that the proper response to content one does not enjoy is to take the extremely minimal and effortless steps required to see that one does not consume said content.",Phasechange,1345163083.0,Fri Aug 17 02:24:43 2012,1.0,mod,413070,0,11549.0,0.0

I've had a similar debate with myself. Dinged DZ 50, bought all the vendor schematics, had ~20 yellow Div Techs due to leveling DZ rank.

Tried farming it for a day (7h or so), got 0 yellows from boxes and 2 from mobs. All of the boxes on servers I phased to were already open before I reached them. After that said fuck it, and went back to doing what I enjoy (challenge missions, random DZ fun, rogue pvp etc.)

I have 0 crafted DZ gear on me, everything I have is either crafted BoO or challenge drops (including almost perfect rolls on Vector and AK 74) and I'm sitting at 165k dps (45% crit chance, 149% crit damage + gloves bonus), 88k hp and 12k skill power, with all the best gear talents. I'm very satisfied with my gear.

In it's current iteration, I will absolutely not farm Div Tech boxes, ever.

DayZ for example was the first game of its type trying to emulate a persistent character experience in the kind of world it was presenting.

7DTD is a game I also own but its zombie AI is probably the most ridiculously simple AI I've ever seen...because player = here (spawn zombies) and it doesn't really matter if you're in plain sight or if you're 80 blocks underground, there are zombies pretty much right on top of your position at all times...its kind of annoying, but I think they did a good job with the crafting and survival elements.

The Forest is relatively less known, and its pretty cool but its mostly a single player experience.

SOE has the experience and the infrastructure to actually pull off a large server environment with character persistence and data storage for related possessions the player has.

So overall, 7DTD...The Fun Pimps are good guys but its literally just Rick and Joel Huenik doing that game. The Forest is single player only.

11068,"I had a similar experience. I completely understand if a parent initially acts irrationally. I was raised Catholic and had lost faith in God after my Grandmother passed away and after the sex scandals came about as well.

My Mom is Catholic, but not a fundy. She believes in Evolution, the Big Bang, all that stuff. She's Progressive. So when I told her I had become an Atheist, her reaction floored me. She was so distraught and immediately started crying. She was scared I was forever lost and felt she had failed me in her upbringing. I had to assure her I was joking. Before she finally calmed down.

Years later, I came back around to Christ on my own terms. She never pressured me after that initial outburst. I told her that (truthfully) I believe in God, but I don't identify with the Catholic church anymore. She was absolutely fine with that, and she realized then that I wasn't joking back then. So she told me straight up that yes, she would have been upset but she eventually would have gotten over it and realized it would be fine. I believe her.

My point is I hope all of you are understanding that when you reveal something that major to someone you care about, they may not be able to handle the initial shock, and, to me, that's okay. They need time to process it. However, what this mother did *after* the initial shock is indeed horrible. And I pray she realizes this before its too late.

Based on the limited info, it appears the top 1/3 of the wall is buckling.  

This is usually something that occurs in the middle of the wall but in this case it makes sense that the top portion of the wall is bending because the door jams appear to be steel and are strengthing the lower portion of the wall - not allowing bending in this area.  

I'm guessing the upper crack is almost in the middle of distace between the upper floor and the top of the door.  Also, the side of the wall facing the camera appears to be in tension (the top of the wall is falling away from the camera) as the upper crack is wider than the lower crack.

There is a slim chance this is caused by settling under that specific area of the building, but the cracking IMO is too uniform... and thus not likely the case.

Here is a good picture:

http://www.twin-cities-inspections.com/home_inspection/advicearticles_foundations.html

This of course is based on one picture only.  A lot of field inspection/site analysis would be needed to ensure this is actually occuring and figure out why and what is going on for sure.

We have never been closer to communism than that dreaded year of 1791!

Anyway, I thought the fed was private? Can you guys get your talking points in line? Having a national bank is a bit different than a full nationalization of the banking system (an example of which would be France in the early 80's). And it's notable that the period of time in which we did not have a national bank is referred to as ""The Guilded Age"" in modern history books.

In this role they've been used numerous times to display that the US was unhappy, and if they continued, we could quickly prevent them from flying any planes and bomb their ground forces.

I have an app and its going to have these features in it :

**SCREENS :**

* Home { Show recent posts from all categories (API provides 30 posts per page)}
* Categories {Show all Categories List }
* By-Category {Show recent posts by category (API provides 30 posts per page)}
* Post {Show Post Details with Comments }
* User-Profile {Show User Profile with their recent posts (API provides 30 posts per page)}
* Profile-Setting {Show Updatable Fields and Update Button}

Now, Where i am confused :

1. Should I fill the whole store with API in the starting or should I make API calls for each screen when they are opened ?
2. And for updating, like If user likes post then should I show a spinner or something till API completes OR should I update the local store value instantly and then call the API ?",aashish_choudhary,1566349124.0,Wed Aug 21 02:58:44 2019,1.0,no mod,2278,0,1.0,0.0

That is a a couple orders of magnitude. And that is a real difference. There are roughly four branches of military. Let's double that number to $500 million for kicks. Than the military would spend two orders of magnitude less on an institution that only employs a fourth. 

Wow, judging by your numbers the military would be very, very, very **very** frugal, when, instead, we know they are the total opposite.

Ok. Of those 45,000, how many died of self-inflicted wounds? That is, people who die because of chronically-unhealthy lifestyle choices? 

For example: We all know smoking causes cancer. Does that mean we should have an unlimited medical subsidy for the people that suffer from cancer caused by smoking? 

So maybe, because of healthcare costs, we should instead outlaw those grossly unhealthy behaviors. But then where do you stop? Motorcycles? Parachuting? Really big buckets of sugary soda? French Fries? 

Our government is not good at doing only a little bit of something. As Reagan said, ""There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government program."" As a pilot, I still chuckle at the ""temporary flight restriction"" zones that have been up since 9/11/01. Twelve years later and it's more permanent than my mortgage.

So if you let them into healthcare, you're inviting them to regulate almost everything you do in the name of your health.

11415,As a gay guy I disagree with lifting the ban. This ban was in place for very good reasons. Gay people are more likely to have HIV and they're also more likely to have it and not even know due to lack of testing and the three month time window for detection. I have not heard any good reason for lifting the ban. It just seems to be mainly a mentality where straight people can do it so we as gay people should be able to do it as well.,None,1315489265.0,Thu Sep  8 15:41:05 2011,23.0,none,413070,0,,

11431,"So one day I was weawing shoes, and they wewe pwetty comfowtabwe. I decided they wewe good to wawk in, so I wawked in them. That wasn’t so bad, so I kept doing it fow the west of the day.

Ovew the next fouw days, my shoes got mowe and mowe comfowtabwe, and I wondewed if it wouwd continue. I asked anothew pewson about this, and they said “No—youw paiw’s just being bwoken in. It stawts off stiff but then adapts to youw foot shape.”

I thought that was pwetty coow. But it wouwdn’t wast fowevew, as the pewson said. So then I weawized that the shoes wouwd go on, but they wouwd begin to stay the same. I wondewed how I couwd change that.

When I got home, I googwed “Things to do with shoes” so I wouwd know how to spice it up with them. Tuwns out, you can tie shoewaces! I had just been using tape to keep my shoes cwosed awound my feet. I took the tape off, and puwwed off the shoes; then, I weawized that they wewe Vewcwo.

I googwed “What to do with Vewcwo shoes” but didn’t get many answews. Unfowtunatewy, I had shoes that I couwdn’t do much with. I couwdn’t twy out cwazy knots ow anything, ow whip peopwe with wong waces. But! Thewe was one thing that I wanted to twy out.

When I got to a cwowded pwace the next day, I wemembewed what I had decided: I wouwd pwactice fiwst. Immediatewy, I bent down and stawted appwying and un-appwying the stwaps, making some noise. Peopwe began to wawk awound me in a ciwcwe.

It wowked!

Ovew the next few months, I made noise with my shoes, mastewing the awt of moving a cwowd and making noise with Vewcwo.

I was weady, now. This was a pwetty coow thing to do with Vewcwo shoes, I had to admit.

I went up to Times Squawe, five paiws of shoes in each hand; having mastewed the awt of tewekineticawwy moving theiw Vewcwo stwaps, I had the powew of the ancients in my hands. I thwew them into theiw positions, and with whythmic Vewcwo-snapping, I summoned it. The Wace, the Stwap. The Shoe-cwosew.

It beckoned to me, as the peopwe in the stweets wan. It asked what I had summoned it fow.

With sheew couwage keeping me going, I said two wowds: “Woudew Vewcwo.” The Shoe-cwosew nodded, and weft. I knew it had fuwfiwwed my wequest.

Aftew I was no wongew on nationaw tewevision, I made my way to a cwowded stweet. I bent ovew, wooking at my shoes. I knew what I wanted to do.

I wipped the stwap, making a 100 dB noise, expwoding aww caws awounding and pewmanentwy deafening mysewf. I gwinned.

11531,"> if you are smart and morally bankrupt and want to accrue wealth at the expense of others

You have no idea what you're talking about. In a proper society with free markets, one would not be allowed to use force to steal from others, so there would be no accruing wealth at the expense of others (unless you think that businesses which deal with their employees and customers on a voluntary basis somehow earn profits at someone's expense, which is ridiculous and false). In fact, the system we have now is what allows people to steal from others:

>""You called it selfish and cruel that men should trade value for value - you have now established an unselfish society where they trade extortion for extortion. **Your system is a legal civil war, where men gang up on one another and struggle for possession of the law, which they use as a club over rivals, till another gang wrests it from their clutch and clubs them with it in their turn, all of them clamoring protestations of service to an unnamed public's unspecified good**. You had said that you saw no difference between economic power and political power, between the power of money and the power of guns - no difference between reward and punishment, between purchase and plunder, between pleasure and fear, between life and death. You are learning the difference now.""

11565,"It's not entirely what you're asking, but there are things called [hot spots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_%28geology%29). The long and short of it is that magma pushes from the inner crust and eventually grows up from the ocean floor and forms land above sea level. Famous examples are [Hawaii](http://www.punaridge.org/doc/factoids/hawaii/HawaiiFig1.jpg) or [Samoa](http://icons.wxug.com/hurricane/chrisburt/sammap.jpg) but here are some [others](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/CourtHotspots.png). Anyway, these guys are constantly forming new land. They have been for millions of years, no joke. It's no big deal though because it's such a brutally slow process and it's so obvious who the new little land lumps belong to - whoever controls that hot spot island chain.

It's also a seriously moot point because young islands on hot spots look like [this](http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/japan-volcano-island.jpg). You're looking at the glorious horror that is the birth of an island. Not many countries are willing to fight over each other for that. Now once that baby is all grown up and looks like Hawaii?

*If* the tat is striking, *and* synergises with the aesthetics of where you're getting it, then fantastic. Imagine you're customizing an avatar. Make it look awesome and non-arbitrary, part of a deliberate design aesthetic, or forget the whole thing.

I used to do a 'Scott routine' before our pre-shift meetings, poking fun at his delivery style and imitating his voice as he asked us to sell the daily specials.

My concern at this point is that even if I dispute with paypal today, I don't know if the time has run out on that clock... maybe this is your reason for the 'policy' in the first place.

When I asked support about this I had to wait for a snotty response which in no way addressed my concerns.

The reason for the refund was that when I made my purchase I allowed the 'suggested' location for instant setup and was then told (after paying) that there wasn't room for me but it was ""being worked on"" with no ETA.

Once it was finally set up I found out that any mods had to be manually approved by your staff which simply means EXTREMELY slow updates and a server that is always behind the norm.

Given the TERRIBLE responses, general bad policy and slow support I can only say that (from my experience) multiplay is the worst gsp I've ever been involved with.

11715,"I think it would be really helpful to categorize the type of content we get on the sub as we talk about what we want the sub to look like. These are the different things I see on the sub:

1. **Code questions**: Stack Overflow types of questions that even sometimes get cross-posted. These can be really useful to people trying to solve specific questions, but I think the reason they often get downvoted is because they seem to be beginner questions more often than not, and there are a lot of people on the sub who are past that level. Of course, we should welcome beginners, but I think we should try to help beginners learn how to answer questions with their own resources. It's a skill that can be learned and I think we should try to pass it on. And even the skill of asking a good question - Stack Overflow actually has pretty good guidelines on how to ask questions that are more likely to get good answers.
2. **Vague, entry-level questions**:  Questions like ""react-native vs flutter,"" ""will react-native be around for a long time,"" ""should I use firebase,"" etc) which aren't helpful to many members of the sub (because they're asked every day), but could probably be served by one of those weekly q/a threads that a lot of subs have.
3. **Blog posts**: I feel like there should be some filter for low-quality blog posts. I see a ""get started with react-native and firebase"" blog post every other day, it seems. I would love to see more really high-quality blog posts on the sub - for instance, the Airbnb series on why they left react native was very high quality and good for discussion as a community.
4. **Advanced Topics**: We don't see a lot of this on the sub. It's hard for me to grow more as a react-native developer. I'm good at implementing stuff in react-native. But how do we implement complex background logic? What are good architecture practices? How do we remain mindful of memory? How do we ensure super-fast performance? I've read about different things related to these, but it would be really great to have more content targeting advanced developers.",None,1544551395.0,Tue Dec 11 19:03:15 2018,1.0,none,2278,0,,

Extra information I put in the self post:

From the video description: 

This is a film made from footage of the Haiti Kids Kino Project during March and April 2010. Volunteers from the Cube Cinema, Bristol, UK, took a mobile children's cinema to Port au Prince to screen free programmes of international children's films and run video workshops for children effected by the January earthquake.

The screenings you can see in the film are in Cite Soleil, Delmas, and Quatre Mains, and Leogane.

HKKP is planning to return to Haiti with a new team of volunteers in late 2011.

You can find out more about the project at http://nanoplex.cubecinema.com/haiti_kids_kino.php


**EDIT:** From the blog - On October 18th three Cube volunteers will be flying out to do four weeks of outdoor cinema and video workshops with children displaced by the 2010 earthquake.

1) high blood pressure.

I don't necessarily mean an acute elevation. (Which is bad, but not too common.) but I see too many folks ignoring their ""borderline"" hypertension or not wanting to start medicine/exercise/diet etc. By the time we've diagnosed you with high blood pressure, your arteries have probably already sustained some damage. 

And people worry rightfully about high BP causing heart attacks and strokes and aneurysms, but kidney disease tends to sneak up on people. Ask your doc to check your renal function.

2) diabetics, get your eyes checked. Retinopathy will sneak up on you before you notice it.

3) quit smoking. As a doc, if I see you come in with any of the stuff folks have posted here, and I see you have a significant pack history I get a bit more scared.

Edit: actually, everything I said in 1) also applies to high blood sugar.

11768,">If this is true, then why do the poor in the US have worse health care outcomes compared to the poor in many EU countries that have nationalized healthcare? Why are community clinics swamped with patients, and so many die without care?

That is a gigantic discussion, but here's the very short summary:
Healthcare as we have it is a wreck. We are under seige by medical equipment manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, the AMA and the health insurance industry all of whom are more interested in protecting their own profit margin than they are providing a streamlined standard of care. 

Defensive medicine is a very real thing, and the actual cost of healthcare is a closely guarded secret, so the consumer can't make any remotely rational choice about care because they are railroaded down a single option that is based too heavily on their ability to pay. If you have insurance, why WOULDN'T you take the $10,000 a dose medication option, whether a $4 generic would work or not? The opposite side of that argument is that people who need the $10,000 a dose medication can't get it and why on earth does it cost $10,000 a dose here and so much else for the same pill in another country? 

>Why are community clinics swamped with patients, and so many die without care?

How many die due to lack of medical care? Do you really have a source for that? 

>Charity organizations in the US can not tackle the scale of the healthcare problem by themselves. Never have been able to.

11801,"It's always the locked/removed threads... After a certain point, the top thread has more than enough advice. That sounds harsh, but... When we see it being brigaded, or reduced to bickering 10+comments deep and nothing significant is being said, it's distracting from the original point or even other posts that are just as deserving of a thoughtful outside opinion. That's at what, 200-ish comments?

People posting updates are my favorite, because that means that OP feels like the community's input merits some closure, and it also means that regular users in the community understand a kind of accountability to the advice they give. But there's always that *one guy* who has to say something about how the previous thread got locked-- and it's probably one of the parties engaged in the previous thread's petty squabble. 

*""The mods locked/deleted the thread for some reason.*""

That's always followed by derailing comments complaining about the mod team (""Ugh, I hate that! rabble rabble tyranny"") rather than focusing on the issue posted, and I'm there like a girl getting herself a beer at a house party listening to drunks in the kitchen talking trash about other party guests like they think no one can hear them. *I'm right here, guys. I usually am. That's why they made me a mod.*

""Some reason."" That reason could be the gendered slurs, obvious trolls, or problematic users we spotted and removed before most commenters could even see them. Some posts just attract such things, and when we feel that the OP has been helped, it's time to shut it down before it turns too big or too harmful.

* terror suspect trials
* the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case
* the 2002 Winter Olympics
* Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's [hospitalization in New York](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&dat=19791023&id=1gxUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tIwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6635,4018422)

* the murder of John Lennon in New York City

>US political decisions that directly affect foreign countries:

* the [Magnitsky Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act)
* US's decision to invade Iraq in 2003

**What qualifies as ""news""?**

> The Carlyle Group is known for its politically connected executives such as former President George H. W. Bush, former Secretary of State James Baker, and former British Prime Minister John Major.

the Carlyle Group ties all of them together.  $100,000/speech payments to George H.W. Bush.  a $50,000,000 infusion of money from the Rothschild agent [Soros](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_rothschild.htm).  and to top it off, this report of ties with Bin Laden himself.

11927,"For the lazy, the bit:

>*Sony gave the PS4 50% more raw shader performance, plain and simple (768 SPs @ 800MHz vs. 1152 SPs & 800MHz). Unlike last generation, you don't need to be some sort of Jedi to extract the PS4's potential here. The Xbox One and PS4 architectures are quite similar, Sony just has more hardware under the hood. We’ll have to wait and see how this hardware delta gets exposed in games over time, but the gap is definitely there.*

After reading [this article by Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-spec-analysis-xbox-one), I found the above analysis by AnandTech very interesting.

The part of the Eurogamer article that refers to the gamble PS made with GDDR5 RAM:

>*In terms of the GPU hardware, hard information was difficult to come by, but one of the engineers did let slip with a significant stat - 768 operations per clock. We know that both Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are based on Radeon GCN architecture and we also know that each compute unit is capable of 64 operations per clock. So, again through a process of extrapolation from the drip-feed of hard facts, the make-up of the One's GPU is confirmed - 12 compute units each capable of 64 ops/clock gives us the 768 total revealed by Microsoft and thus, by extension, the 1.2 teraflop graphics core. So that's another tick on the Durango leaked spec that has been transposed across to the final Xbox One architecture and the proof we need that PlayStation 4's 18 CU graphics core has 50 per cent more raw power than the GPU in the new Microsoft console. Now, bearing in mind that we fully expect PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to launch at similar price-points, how did this disparity come about?*

>*The answer to that comes down to a specific gamble Sony made that Microsoft could not - the utilisation of a unified pool of GDDR5 memory. In the early days of PS4 development, only 2GB of this type of memory looked viable for a consumer-level device. As higher density modules became available, this was duly upgraded to 4GB. By the time of the reveal back in February, Sony had confidence that it could secure volume of 512MB modules and surprised everyone (even developers) by announcing that PS4 would ship with 8GB of unified GDDR5 RAM. The design of its surrounding architecture would not need to change throughout this process - one set of 16 GDDR5 chips would simply be swapped out for another.*

>*Microsoft never had the luxury of this moving target. With multimedia such a core focus for its hardware, it set out to support 8GB of RAM from day one (at the time giving it a huge advantage over the early PS4 target RAM spec) and with serious volume of next-gen DDR4 unattainable in the time window, it zeroed in on supporting DDR3 and doing whatever was necessary to make that work on a console. The result is a complex architecture - 32MB of ESRAM is added to the processor die, along with ""data move engines"" to courier information around the system as quickly as possible with bespoke encode/decode hardware to alleviate common bottlenecks. Bottom line: if you're wondering why Xbox One has a weaker GPU than PlayStation 4, it's because both platform holders have similar silicon budgets for the main processor - Sony has used the die-space for additional compute units and ROPs (32 vs. 16 in One), while Microsoft has budgeted for ESRAM and data move engines instead. From the Xbox perspective, it's just unfortunate for Microsoft that Sony's gamble paid off - right up until the wire, it was confident of shipping with twice the amount of RAM as PlayStation 4.*",Skitrel,1369459404.0,Sat May 25 07:23:24 2013,30.0,mod,114934,0,5749.0,0.0

11941,"The issue with this is that the dude called Chanan Reitblat a ""terrorist."" Which is likely why he got a fine and a slap on the wrist.    

I certainly don't think calling Israel's supporters ""terrorists"" is acceptable but to be honest I also don't think any of this is an issue of law, and rather something that should have been settled either in private or using the University's own discipline policies.     

The dude is likely an ass, just not an ass who deserved £300 fine and a 150 hour community order - seems disproportional. In particular when a lot of burglars get community orders or [less](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-381799/Let-burglars-caution-police-told.html).    

That all being said - the term ""terrorist state"" is very un-useful. While I have some issues with what Israel chooses to do in the West Bank, and I certainly might be inclined to accuse them of ethnic cleansing, almost every Western country could reasonably be accused of being a ""terrorist state.""

12137,"You shouldn't have to apologize. The end game is a gear grind, am I wrong?

The whole purpose of the DZ and safe house vendors are to reward you for merciless grinding? Sure PVP is an aspect but without grinding fro gear there's no point to PVP. While challenging missions are suppose to be a challenge it's also where you get better gear, so the purpose is to grind the challenge missions, right?

The only difference between you and a less dedicated gamer is that your dug in and burned the candle at both ends to grind out division tech. Most everyone else will not do what you did to such hardcore levels. 

I agree that grinding is ridiculous, not just with the division but with RNG styled games in general. Personally, I don't think RNG should be the sole factor in determining how you get gear. Some aspects can be predicated on RNG like talents and which type of gear you get. But for the most part you should be in control of your loot destiny. Taking on tougher bosses should haeavily factor into high end drop success. It's gotten better with the last update but still, in my opinion, it's too low. 

If drop rates will stay where they are PXC should have high value. It shouldn't cost 20% of the PXC cap for a single blueprint which in and of itself has an RNG system. Instead, the price should be halved and crafting mats should be available for purchase.

12190,"1) Modern TVs have hardware HEVC decoders. The decoding is handled directly by a chip. Doing so, you can get much better performance than software decoding on a PC (using the CPU).

Hardware decoding is coming for PCs through NVIDIAs and AMDs latest graphics cards though.

2) 4K at 60fps in HEVC is **very ressource consuming**. That your i7 3930K can't handle it doesn't surprise me at all.

Haswell CPUs might help as they support the AVX2 instruction set, which is intensely used by software HEVC decoders.

I have an i5-4670k overclocked at 4.3GHz and I can barely play 4K@60 smoothly.

3) You can try to get a recent player (MPC-HC 1.7.8 for example), because VLC has very poor performance with HEVC at the moment.

If it's not enough, overclock your CPU.

If it's still not enough, get a graphics card with hardware HEVC playback : GeForce GTX 960 for example.

Hope that helps.",Elyotna,1432521781.0,Mon May 25 04:43:01 2015,3.0,no mod,"419,772",1,103.0,0.0

I don’t walk more than 3 dogs at a time. So my dogs usually fall into a “special” category like senior, shy/reactive, smoosh faces that don’t need a lot of exercise, etc. 

I charge $25/30 mins with a small pack or $30 solo. I try to be competitive with Wag since it’s such a huge presence now. The difference is you get the same person every walk. I have personal relationships with my doggos.

12310,"As the originator of that post concerning day/night cycle I want to thank you for responding to the concern. 

My suggestion is to offset the box time to allow for daytime to occur during peak hours for that region. 

Barring that set server time so that either dawn or dusk occurs midway between restarts.  

These two options are the best currently available to resolve the issue.  The weather updates coming to stable build soon should help remove that SSDD feel as well making the second option as viable as the first. 

I have always had the best performance on your servers but could not stand the blanket time setting.  I actually found the policy noted while browsing to try and rent a server that would run full cycle and hardcore.  I have a list of posters here and friends that would definitely be interested in a combination of full day night/hardcore and we have all discussed the option of pooling to rent a server if those options could be provided.

12379,"Not anywhere I've been. I've heard of instances at other bases yes, but none at the bases I've worked at at the time. 

I would think that in the UK military, most women would have experienced behaviour that they themselves consider to be offensive, some of it will have a sexual angle too, but I have no problem with that up to a point, I shall try to explain why. 

We all have different things that offend us, and what offends one person won't offend another. So you have a new girl come into the unit and something that has always been a part of that unit, i.e. some form of banter or whatever, I'm not talking about inappropriate touching and that sort of thing, that is obviously something that shouldn't go on, but stuff like topless calendars or whatever. So if that girl comes into the unit I have no problem whatsoever if she experiences something she finds offensive, say a topless girlie calendar that other girls have had no problems with in the past. She is within her rights to not like it and it would be removed permanently if she made a complaint. What I would have a problem with is if she had to experience it again, because people would have been told and the situation dealt with. The same goes for slightly risque comments, once is not an issue because you deal with it and stop it, twice is a problem because then it is becoming persistent and deliberate. 

All working environments are different and there needs to be a common sense approach to managing our personnel. So while we may have a large proportion of girls (and guys maybe too) who have at one time or another will have experienced offensive things, and as I said that's fine because they can be dealt with. We just cannot remove all potentially offensive things, because you'd get rid of everything. My opinion is that the best approach is common sense and working with our guys to give them the best working environment to allow them to do the valuable jobs that they do on a daily basis.

[Remember this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/2m5exo/spoiler_s07e10_jax_priorities_not_the_shoes/) Nero said that if Jax went through with killing his mom he would lose his soul. He would be beyond saving. The shoes were bloodied by his moms death in the garden. He was too bloodied to be saved just like his shoes.

It just makes sense to sell one of the most crucial exports in the world and power the nation using a fuel that is cheap and plentiful around the world (increasing the likelihood of finding a friendly buyer).

I like the idea of using it to enhance stuff great idea but players will use it to take advantage of other players.  And IMHO thats the one bad thing about these survival games, the opportunity to be a douchebag is so much stronger than the opportunity to coexit with others.  Not to try and point fingers but look at 2 of the top survival games out right now DayZ and Rust.  People killing each other for nothing or using there advantage ( weapons and time spent advancing in the game ) vs new players coming into the game is over the top.  But how can a dev team / company balance that.. i really dont think you can.  Its all based on the morals of the player playing the game and when you add in all these COD kiddies and FPS brats you end up with Rust / DayZ.  Just me 2 cents.

But i love the whole idea of using it to improve your items / gear / weapons

12561,"Ok, I'm going to need somebody to explain this to me...

1) Why does anyone actually care if Iran has nuclear weapons? Is it solely a matter of one more variable in the equation increasing the likelyhood of an atomic confrontation? Is it not a nations sovereign right to develop equipment like this?

2) Why does anyone care if Israel has nuclear weapons or not? Same reason? To counter hypocrisy? Same reason as Iran? Is it because US tax payers footed the bill?

3) Why does it matter that the United States was involved? French and British involvement during the Second World War in the Manhattan project, while not actually leading to direct development of European warheads, definitely gave these countries a good footing on their own development.

Furthering that, the US has worked with NATO counterparts on nuclear policy multiple times. So why does the same thing with Israel spark controversy? France has exhibited a similar flavor of disdain towards both the UN and NATO, why don't we worry about them, too?

I agree with the statement of hypocrisy towards Iran; but not in a sense that I think we need to check Israel as well.

Bear in mind, these are genuine questions. A lot of the fighting going on right now over this honestly confuses me, and I'd like some answers as to why people worry about this.",Slukaj,1359625595.0,Thu Jan 31 10:46:35 2013,2.0,mod,32087,0,7067.0,0.0

Legality will vary by state (in the US) and country.

Generally you should not intervene.  It could be dangerous for you.  Best thing to do is just be a good witness.

If an officer specifically asks for help, you should (and may be required to in some states) if you can.

If you do intervene, you could be held liable if the suspect is injured.  *Could*.  From experience suspects will sue for anything, but will generally try to sue the police because they have more money.

If you live in a state where you're required to help an officer if he asks, you're generally covered by the department.

12587,"[Jester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jester)

>In ancient times, courts employed fools and by the Middle Ages the jester was a familiar figure. In Renaissance times, aristocratic households in Britain employed licensed fools or jesters, who sometimes dressed as other servants were dressed, but generally wore a motley (i.e. parti-coloured) coat, hood with ass's (i.e. donkey) ears or a red-flannel coxcomb and bells. Regarded as pets or mascots, they served not simply to amuse but to criticise their master or mistress and their guests. Queen Elizabeth (reigned 1558-1603) is said to have rebuked one of her fools for being insufficiently severe with her. Excessive behaviour, however, could lead to a fool being whipped, as Lear threatens to whip his fool.

Personally, I think the more a topic lends itself to jokes and puns, in general THE MORE WRONG the accepted perception on the topic is. Basically jokes might be a valuable bullshit meter. It's a way to deconstruct and change perspective on something.

12607,"Update: It may have something to do with bid increments that I am not fully comprehending, along with a confusingly arranged or presented bid log on eBay's part (not out of the question).

&#x200B;

I have found some threads on eBay forums where people are suggesting that if the bids are close *enough*, then the winning bid is exact (and perhaps the truth of thelosing bid is reflected poorly in the log?):

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I.e. If someone has already bid $87.50, and I bid $88.88, my bid wins in the exact amount, rather than rounding to $88 or something. Some are suggesting it's in the terms that if bids are within $5, something like this goes into effect. A little confused, but maybe an explanation. Much more conceivable that two people bid within $5 of each other than the exact same obscure amount.

&#x200B;

The log data could be an inexact portrayal of a bidding process in which the high bid and auto-bid are different amounts.

&#x200B;

Also noticed the losing buyer's bid actually shows up in the log \*after\* my bid. So idk.

12609,"This seems appealing, but a problem with this approach is that you can't cancel/clean up any running effects when the component unmounts/rerenders, leading to bugs and strange behaviour. That's why useEffect's design lets you return a cleanup function. This is not possible with async functions, since they will always return a promise. 

I usually define an async function separately and call it from inside useEffect


    async function somethingAsync(){
       // await stuff
       return value
    }

    // ... 

    useEffect(() => {
      const val = somethingAsync()
      return () => {
        // cleanup/cancellation logic
      }
    })

in the (nearish?) future, suspense should be a better option for data fetching requirements. 

edit: I now see you allow for a destroy function as an argument, but it still wouldn't have access to any vars inside the function. Maybe that's sufficient for some usecases.  ",bangude,1543332146.0,Tue Nov 27 16:22:26 2018,4.0,no mod,2278,0,1.0,0.0

It had an effective range of 100 meters but was capable of firing to 250 meters. It fired a .75 musket ball made of lead, which was contained as part of a paper tube made from Cartridge Grade paper which contained gunpowder. The soldier would remove the cartridge from the cartridge box, bite off the end to release the powder, pour a small amount into the pan and the rest down the barrel. The now empty cartridge still attached to the musket ball would then be placed into the barrel as wadding and the ramrod used to ram it down. The musket would be cocked and was then ready to fire. When the trigger was pulled the hammer containing the flint would strike the frizzen, causing sparks to ignite the gunpowder in the pan and pass through the touch hole to ignite the main charge and fire the musket ball. A well drilled soldier was capable of firing 4 shots a minute",RabidMortal,1431000589.0,Thu May  7 14:09:49 2015,3.0,no mod,"1,398,796",1,1626.0,0.0

As for your question: percentage stays true to its power when the sample size is large enough. In a small sample size, the outcomes may be skewed to not reflect actual data. 

For example, if I flip a coin 5 times, and it comes up as heads 4 times, you'll still know intuitively that the odds are 50:50, not 80:20, because it's a chance game. Over 50 tries, you'd probably end up with something like a 52:48 split, or something really close to 50:50, because as we increase our sample size, our experiment starts to resemble reality more and more.",Rawtoast24,1410587059.0,Sat Sep 13 07:44:19 2014,3.0,mod,"419,772",1,26911.0,0.0

12764,"Some thoughts:

1) How great a problem is ""group think"" that it needs such a solution? From my perspective submissions that get upvoted a lot tend to be quite popular or important news items, which is why they're upvoted in the first place. If ""group think"" is tackled properly and removed, then a submission might see 50 upvotes instead of 100, but so will every other important or popular news item, so it makes no difference.

2) Why are you hiding karma on comments? Is it simply because you can't hide submission karma and show comment karma at the same time due to CSS limitations?

3) I think a better solution to address the problem of some items not getting their due attention is to abolish the ""What's Hot"" page entirely, and instead only show visitors the ""What's New"" page. This would mean that every submission has the same exposure to every visitor (At the moment not everyone visits the ""What's New"" page). It would also mean that news items are fully visible when they're submitted, as ""News"" items should be, instead of once they get enough upvotes to make it to the ""What's Hot"" page. Given that we have strict rules and offending submissions are removed rapidly, there's no reason not to expose the ""What's New"" page to the sunlight :P",None,1309794915.0,Mon Jul  4 17:55:15 2011,4.0,none,114934,0,,

It's an article in the [BBC's magazine section](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine/) (I never even knew that existed), which covers a wide range of topics.

Over the course of season 7 Don slowly starts rebuilding his life. By the end of the season he and Megan repair their marriage, he has a good relationship with his kids, and he builds a successful firm and brings back all the regulars. The point is everyone is happy. However, that's not the end and that's not how the universe works. The last minute cuts to Don in the year 2001 on the sofa smoking a cigarette and overlooking Manhattan like the end of the intro scene. The camera cuts to the calender, it is September 11th. Suddenly you see a plane fly  into the building. Don stands up, moves toward the window, and jumps. He becomes the [falling man.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falling_Man)


The point is that even though Don put together his life again, sometimes there are moments in life that you simply cant control - the universe is indifferent.

12880,"It's been a long time since I played, but there is one PS story that has stuck in my mind.

We were fighting for one of the inner ring bases on Searhus (Pele, Akua, Oro, Ngura).  Us lowely Vanu were getting spanked as we tended to on our server.  We hatched a brilliant and totally un-heard of plan that involved our squad loading up for a gal drop (I know, totally unheard of, right?).  Me, being the awesome support player that I was... was the certified galaxy pilot for the day.  We get the gal, load up, and head off to our destination.

Now, if you remember the Inner ring of Searhus, the bases are way high.  Many of the mountains in that area are over 400m high, and the bases aren't far from that height also.  The flight ceiling being at 400m from sea level, means there isn't much room to work.  We come blasting in just as fast as that galaxy will take us (so the mountain snails waved as they passed us).

We get REAL close to the base and the drop is almost on us.  Of course we started to take a lot of AA fire so I did my best to avoid it, being the stellar pilot that I am, in the superbly maneuverable aircraft the Galaxy is.  Right as I trigger off the macro that yelled for everyone to drop.... we bounced off the flight ceiling.

Gal took a 45 degree pitch down as everyone jumped.

12957,"I know that nobody likes getting sand pounded in their ass while playing this game.  That isn't why anyone comes here.  We come here to play with our friends.  A large number of you, I consider friends, and I'm glad we have this community to play with, because frankly, my friends list is full, but I know I can come to this server and play with some friendly voices.  (I'd say faces, but I've never actually met any of you in real life.)  We are growing though, and a lot of new people are showing up, which is great.  The more the merrier.  

I went from a player that mostly played as a pub, had my fun, ganged up on the weak, and generally defined my fun as winning.  Then I met some TA guys and started playing with them about a month or so before the Server patch.  One of my first introductions was LVL Asian I Win.  Let me tell ya, he did.  Almost every match, he was on the winning team, in large part due to him being in either the scout chopper or the attack jets in Rush.  

After this community started to form, I was among the first.  What I've learned along the way is that you can still have fun while *losing* if you're doing so with friends.  You can't win them all.  The point is to not get demoralized by a loss.  You can't even get demoralized by losing most games in a single session.  Lighten up.  Have fun.  Think outside the box, and do something nobody else has tried.  If I'm on a losing team, and nobody seems to want to PTFO or even try to really get out of the spawn, one of my favorite things to do is grab a sniper, sneak away and be a pain in the ass for the other team.  

It isn't all about winning or losing, and it certainly isn't about your stats, be it W/L, K/D, or SPM.  This isn't a dick measuring contest.  Nobody in your real life cares what your stats look like in BF3.  You came here to have fun.  So have fun.  Don't define your fun by winning or losing.  Studies have shown that with regards to gaming, your brain releases the same endorphin levels when you die in game as they do when you kill an opponent.  Its all in the mindset.  When you let someone demoralize you by beating you in a video game, you're giving them the power over how much fun you have.  Make your own fun...that's what we're all here for anyway.",digitalklepto,1340118499.0,Tue Jun 19 17:08:19 2012,2.0,mod,114934,0,1463.0,0.0

Nobody is forcing you to do all that farming. Do your weapons suck? Are you unable to fight effectively?  Do you just want something different?

You are punishing yourself for whatever reason you have in your head that you need to do all that.

13052,"So, you say that know, you enjoy progression by collecting DTech ?

I think these discussions shouldn't mix 2 very different aspects :

- Progression (it's a rpg to some extent, so yeah, this matters).
- Pure gameplay fun (the action side).

Most criticisms I read regarding endgame are about some lack of, or tedious progression (and thus, lack of various things to do) past Dz rank 50.
Most defendants I read, counter argument with the fun they experience in game.

Sorry but these are not the same things ..
You can enjoy only the second aspect, and this is fine, but for those who expected more than what the game has to offer currently, regarding progression, DTech is nothing but a timesink bottleneck, which, for now, palliate a lack of items and/or levelling etc.. depth.
It feels a bit short on that side, especially for an AAA game.

I get that, not bothering too much with progression, allows you to enjoy the game more and whine less, nevertheless..

The criticisms regarding progression are still valid to me.

It baffles me to see people so set in their ways to not even listen to the other side. I mean, when you talk about God as an all knowing being who created everything, how is it inconceivable that he could have thought up the idea of evolution? Is that out of his power? Just simply saying that you believe in evolution doesn't automatically mean you're an atheist. I believe that he gave us a world full of questions, and gave us the wit and the thirst for knowledge and understanding to search for and find the answers. That is the thing I find so cool about the world that we live in. People can come together, no matter their beliefs, and search for the answers to the questions we are all asking.

13175,"The thing about this game, and this is what several others has expressed aswell. Is the feeling this game gives, i got nostalgia trips on several occasions, due to how authentic and true it looks and feels visually compared with the Underground games. However there is an issue here and that is how it handles, the maybe most important aspect of a racer, the feedback given back to the player to give an authentic feel that is satisfying and believeable. I can't help but think that if they have had a few more months to really adjust and tune the handling this might have been a true 'comeback' to the series. Another problem i have with it, is how the activities are organized or lack there of, i feel as if they just mashed a bunch of races, drift events and sprints together with no thought of a logical structure. The rubber band A.I is supposedly patched, but there is something else about these A.Is that breaks the immersion completely during a race, they look like they glide on the asphalt rather than actually driving, this becomes to artificial for me unless it has some sort of context, such as rain, high speeds or there being actual ice. And this last complaint may be me having greater expectations now than i had back in 2003 and 2004, but the city is seemingly lifeless, it lacks character, thus fades away the motivation for me spending my time there.",dore123m,1449750622.0,Thu Dec 10 13:30:22 2015,2.0,no mod,"419,772",1,5.0,0.0

Could we have a rule: No hashtags in titles?

Also, no all-caps in titles. If the content of a title isn't enough to get users' attention, then it doesn't deserver their attention.

Also, is there any rule that requires descriptive titles? How do we manage to avoid submission titles like ""Some big news: Check out this article!"". It'd be the GamerNews equivalent of ""Look at this picture my daughter drew.""

Any title that requires you to read the article in order to make sense of it should be banned.

13242,"It should be pointed out that Chomsky doesn't actually endorse this. He thinks no one in their right mind should want Iran to have nuclear weapons.

What he means to point out is that Israel is widely seen as the major aggressor in the region (for good reason), rather than Iran. It's believed that Israel, not Iran, is the greatest threat to peace, and there's serious concern over the fact that it has a sizable nuclear arsenal. Iran is right now staring down the barrel of the collective might of the US and Israeli military powers—and we all know the meaning of the phrase ""all options are on the table"".

There's a lot of propaganda being pushed right now painting Iran as the great nuclear threat, despite the fact there's [no evidence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVbIhkn-0FM) to suggest they're working on anything but a domestic energy program. There are ways to mitigate the threat to the extent that it exists. One way would be to work towards the installation of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. The UN has been trying to do this for some time, but its implementation is being blocked by the US and Israel.",dada_,1335108085.0,Sun Apr 22 17:21:25 2012,1.0,mod,32087,0,24544.0,0.0

13318,"It's an interesting idea that the most racist thing that ever happened to someone is likely unknowable, e.g. an opportunity that never materialized because a racist took it off the table before you even knew it existed. In that vein, I agree that modern racism is very slippery and not as often the straightforward KKK, in-your-face type. When I went to school in Boston, there were numerous occasions where I felt like I was being deliberately ignored, whether at the photo counter where the older Caucasian guy refused to make eye contact and ignored my attempts at getting his attention, or at a steak restaurant where the older Caucasian waitress served everyone around me and my Asian friends, leaving us sitting there for half an hour without so much as a hello before we had to get a manager. The problem in such cases is that you doubt your perception of things. Am I really being ignored, or are they just busy? Are they ignoring me because they don't like my race? My haircut? How I dress?

13375,"What you forget however is that capitalism is an international system. You look at nations individually, ignoring the fact that a nation's wealth might rely on people's misery outside its borders. After Taiwanese companies were done exploiting their own people (it became too expensive), they started improving relationships with China and ruthlessly exploit people on the mainland there instead (see Foxconn etc). 

When people were confronted with the issue of poverty in Latin America, they didn't see themselves as being poor due to laziness or lack of education. No, the saying was ""we are poor, so they (the US) can be rich"". You can still make this case in much of the less developed world. Foreign corporations continue to ruthlessly exploit environment (natural resources) and labour in for example Africa while barely contributing to these nations. Much of the wealth that we enjoy is dependent on the ongoing exploitation outside our borders. 

This is, again, not to say that all suffering is due to capitalism. Capitalism could be implemented in more humane ways. It could do more against extreme poverty (but this would go against the powerful interests). And obviously, capitalism led to immense production increases. If you actually read Marx, you will see him praise capitalism more eloquently than many of the biggest capitalism-apologists. Fact is however, capitalism needs inequality. It always needs something out of itself to exploit in order to reproduce the system on a bigger scale.",Nuyan,1315293233.0,Tue Sep  6 09:13:53 2011,1.0,no mod,413070,0,3844.0,0.0

I love the game. Love playing with friends. Love going on manhunts. Pvping 4vs4. Asserting dominance in dz 6. Going down to dz01 and clearing the griefers. But div tech has to change. And it will.

13397,"The biggest issue was lack of TPs/bots.   The game went 60 mins, and Navi had 0 boots of travel, and several cores had no TPS due to being 6 slotted.  I mean its okay if your defending the entire time not to get BoTs, but when you are ahead as navi was you really need to get them.  Several times players had no way to get back home, and would BKB and try to run back, resulting in extra pick offs sometimes or a lot of wasted time juking/running and losing farm time.  

I mean if you had Dendi and Xboct just push up mid with Bots, as long as they stayed spread out AT MOST one of them would get caught by a ES echo slam if they did BKB +bots, and thats only if ES was camping his base the entire time.  Merlini pointed it out that they had several great timings to split push/rat but without Bots were unable too.

I also have no idea what Sonnekio was doing.  60 Min game, he had 6.3k NW, and had 2.6 of that in gold, AFTER buying back.  His inventory consisted of arcanes, medallion and urn for a 60 min game?  I mean a ghost scepter would have saved him a few times over the duration of the game.  

Here is the game recap and final inventories if anyone is interested

We took the door off of his bedroom since privacy would just tempt him to experiment in the ways teen boys tend to do, and we forbid him from having sleepovers or spending one-on-one time with any of his male friends unsupervised (of course, the same rules apply to female friends, but that's a rule we impose on all our sons). Since romantic relationships can never be a part of his life, we also forbid him from dating (girls, obviously), or participating in activities like his high school prom. We've locked down the family computer with browsing filters, and, unlike our other sons, we never allowed him to have a cell phone, since he might use it to access inappropriate and confusing images.

13507,"First, I'm going to do what I would do with I'm assuming a $2k budget.

First off. Just order everything you can from Newegg. Not only do you get your parts mostly at the same time, but it is much easier ordering the parts and returning anything DOA. 

Okay, I'm going to provide you two options for CPUs. One costs more, but it will be better for your work. They're pretty equal in gaming though. So it's up to you to decide what route to take. I would go with the more expensive route. You're already spending this much money, might as well.

Notes:

Build is crossfire ready.

Went with sticks of RAM instead of 4, to allow for expansion. If this is a problem, I can find a 4 kit and save some money if needed.

Went with Corsair's h2o kit. Looks better in the case and isn't a strain on anything and you dont have to worry about clearance issues.

Changed the SSD, because it's faster. Ignore people and their M4s... M4s rose in popularity because of Sandforce firmware issues, but those were resolved LONG ago. M4s are still higher in price and slower, because people are dumb. I have this exact SSD in my build right now and have for several months. No issues and updating firmware is a breeze if needed.

Went with a blu ray burner for $20 more. Might as well.

I stuck with the hybrid HDD, because there aren't many good HDDs right now. All the good ones are hell expensive and Hitachi's 1 platter 1TB HDD apparently has build issues now ):,,, 

As for the cases, you want one that has good build quality. However, I wouldn't spend more than $120 on a case. Once you get your parts in your case, most people barely do anything else with it. No sense in spending more for novelties.

13575,"Ugh. Feels way too familiar. I was raised by a *very* strict Catholic mother who basically made every decision based on her warped, hyper-miserable view of what the religion was supposed to be like. To describe the particular brand of nuttery I'm talking about, I'll use the word wackadoodle... It's like Catholicism, but cranked up to 11 and distorted by a lot of unofficial nonsense that these people basically make up.

I'm still getting over some of the emotional issues that she left me with at 30.

Some highlights - 

- I wasn't allowed to spend time with friends who weren't Catholic, and never openly approved of any who weren't the kids of other wackadoodles. (I just lied about most of my friends... One Mormon got away with it by vigorously agreeing with her on stuff, so she kind of made him an honorary Catholic and put him on her nice list. I don't think she knew much about Mormons...)

- She told me masturbation, besides leading straight to hell, would make me turn gay and insane. She regularly received and then gave me wackadoodle literature to that effect, or worse. (Did you know pedophilia is caused by masturbation during adolescence? LOL)

- When I didn't have a girlfriend during high school (I was socially awkward) she started asking me if I was gay and trying to aggressively fix me up with her friends' wackadoodle daughters

- To her, all popular culture was bad. If it wasn't bad in an obvious way, she'd get some wackadoodle newsletter that made up a [Black Dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D97gwGlMFE) or [Monster Energy lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bntfUA6TmLs) style justification for why it was bad. She read this fucking book - [Like Lambs to the Slaughter: Your Child and the Occult](http://www.amazon.com/Like-Lambs-Slaughter-Johanna-Michaelsen/dp/0890816174/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1438357462&sr=8-3&keywords=lambs+to+the+slaughter) and that behavior went from frustrating to terrifying for a few years. I wasn't allowed to watch television, read books on her ""bad"" list (virtually everything popular - I grew up in the Goosebumps era, for example, and that was RIGHT out), or play video games. Naturally, I did all of these things on the DL - when I play video games now, at 30 years old, I still feel the impulse to hide the fact that I'm doing so from anyone who might notice.",nickiter,1438357683.0,Fri Jul 31 17:48:03 2015,6.0,mod,"1,398,796",1,12219.0,0.0

Also, it promotes that people give articles a chance instead of blindly trusting the hivemind, which I think is a very unfair thing to do, just look at r/gaming for instance, hardly anything of substance is discussed nor posted there.

13598,"""In games, the characters die all the time. How many times did you let Mario fall in the pit before he saved the princess? Who weeps for these Marios. In games your characters die, but you keep trying and trying and rebooting and resetting until finally they make it. When you play a game this process is all very impersonal. Once you finally win, when all is said and done those deaths didn’t “count”, only the linear path of the final victorious version of the character is considered “real”. Mario never actually died, did he? Except the omniscient player knows better.""

If I think it's a viral marketer I'll check their submission history first. If they only have 4 or 5 submissions, regardless of how long they've been a redditor, and 1 or 2 of those are submissions about products then yea, they're viral marketing. 

Yesterday I saw a post on the frontpage and the user account was only 2 months old. I thought for sure it was a viral marketer until I checked the submitted history. The user had more submissions than me (a 1 year redditor) and they were all over the place, it was obvious the user was just posting to get karma and had finally hit the frontpage.

It's newer, flashier, shinier and has more cutscenes, but ultimately, the core gameplay, the amount of content, all fall short compared to the classics, while other things such as the AI has seemingly not changed one bit since 2004. 


It's cool that Ghost is providing free content updates, and it does seem like they are listening to the fans, but I don't really have much faith that the game would drastically improve overtime. It's not impossible, I mean, Driveclub did it, but, I don't have much confidence in Ghost, simply because Rivals had a bunch of very obvious, major flaws that were never fixed, and in fact, got carried over to NFS2015...

13686,"I posted this a while ago on ECMs (content may be slightly off, but still more or less correct); [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/128762/how_the_freak_do_you_use_the_ecm_jammer_xbox). I reworded and added some content for both ECMs and Flares...


The purpose of the BF3 ECM jammer is to *prevent* missiles from being fired for its duration of 5 seconds. It has a secondary capability of having a *possibility* of distracting an already fired missile. ECMs will deploy for 5 seconds, and recharge for 5. 

 

  **ECM intended use before missile firing:**

Prevents lock-on during duration of chaff. **Note: a slight delay is present between use of ECMs and lock-on protection due to lag!** Deploy when a missile lock begins and get below radar or out of line-of-sight immediately (note that the ECM    effect of breaking a lock is not immediate, and a missile can still be fired after the ECM is depolyed). Or deploy during a strafe/attack run to prevent missile locks during the run.


 

  **ECM missile avoidance after missile firing (not recommended):**

Use ECM promptly after the missile is fired and get below radar (for non-stinger missiles) or behind cover (for stinger missiles). ECM jammmer will usually cause missiles to ""loop"" vertically around helicopters and impact after they stop, or simply just not be functional in missile evasion in the case of jets, due to elongated chaff not covering the fast-moving jet. **Fired missiles will only be distracted when contacting the chaff cloud or hitting another object!**
 


  **Flare use before missile firing (not reccomended):**

Will distract missiles fired after use for (about) 3 seconds

 

  **Flare use after missile firing:**

Will almost always distract fired missiles

In conclusion:

* ECMs are best used to **prevent** a missile lock. For instance, if you know you will be targeted while performing a strafe run, deploy ECMs at the beginning of a run to prevent missile firings.
* Using ECMs to evade a fired missile is not very effective and will often result in failure. Other objects are often needed to block a missile once ECMs are deployed.
* Flares are a much better choice to distract fired missiles
* **JAVELINS ARE NOT COUNTERED BY ECMS OR FLARES**


TDLR;

* Flares best distract fired missles
* ECMS best prevent lock-ons",mr_eman_xbox,1364413913.0,Wed Mar 27 20:51:53 2013,4.0,no mod,114934,0,12.0,0.0

I also check Reddit on an hourly basis during the day and evening.  

And to the extent that one can judge themselves, I'm a very polite and helpful person.  In tense conversations, my main goal is to make sure that everyone leaves happy and content, and I've never failed in that regard, at least on Reddit.

13772,"> We also need to get a few known conservatives on the mod panel ...

We need to get **people with more points of view** on the mod panel. This sub-reddit is called Canada, not CanadaPolitics. As such, the people we trust to operate it (and trust is the major operative issue here) should represent or at least understand as much of Canada as possible. **If a lack of trust due to insufficient **visible** engagement by moderators** is a problem, we need more active moderators who we can trust by their actions.

I happen to live in a Canadian city in which 100,000 Americans also live. I'm also an hour away from cities which tens of thousands of Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, etc. call home despite not being Canadian by citizenship. As such, I have no problems with moderators of other nationalities in /r/Canada **as long as they provide high quality moderation**. 

As has been expressed by hundreds of community members in recent weeks, we have some concerns about the quality of moderation, and I'm glad that such concerns are being constructively entertained.

I know that at least two moderators on the list are active on a daily basis behind the scenes with janitorial stuff, which goes deeply under-appreciated by most of the community. The community has asked for such work to be made visible so that we can better understand, and yes, judge, it as humans tend to want to do. That kind of accountable interaction builds trust in its custodians, which is deeply lacking in this community at the moment. It also builds trust in community members to show that reasonable actions of moderations will be received reasonably.",None,1342793781.0,Fri Jul 20 16:16:21 2012,18.0,none,413070,0,,

Allow relocate of ui placeement. Giving someone the ability to move the ""objective X"" away from the center of the screen if they so choose when you are in that area. Example: Move it more towards the top of the screen and out of the line of site.

Allow vote to lock server teams (promoting competitive gameplay) for one map (or both attack/defend in rush or conquest assault) for console players. This way it would require a majority vote and would make competitive play more feasible without penalizing players for taking up a server.

Battlerecorder of some sort.

Consistent IRNV across all maps or tailored towards maps with less sunlight and greater range of heat sources.

Require mortar users to be spotted in order to show up on minimap and not show up by default. Prevent people from motoring in team deployment area or only auto-show mortar users if they are firing from team deployment area.

Allow more team switching on console if player spots are open. It's very frustrating to play with friends when you can't switch teams more than once without exiting the server and rejoining. Even if a player wants to switch teams away from their friends to help balance the server they can't do so. Allow team switching while alive resulting in death and successful team switch.

While status-quo capitalism doesn't have leaders explicitly condemning people to die, one could argue that the system perpetuates inequalities that cause a similar amount of suffering.  Presently, much of the world lives in poverty and squalor, with high rates of famine, disease, etc.  I don't necessarily believe that all of this is due to capitalism, or would be fixed by switching, but at least some of it is.

Not opposing SOPA is just as bad as supporting in my opinion. They are fine if it passes and they are fine if it doesn't. I would say they have more to gain if it passes and if it fails, then nothing was lost. If they support it however, they lose PR and support. So what do you do in that case? Do nothing, profit.

Maybe this could be a barrel attachment that would add more muzzle flash but reduce recoil?

EDIT: Along these same lines, it's hard to tell but it loks like some of the guns either have massive amounts of recoil, or these players just randomly jerk the mouse up when shooting.

The first discussion the parents had with the kid regarding 'carrying his cross' and ""we're called to chastity"" is absolutely true (again, if you're a practicing Catholic). I'm a straight man in my 20's who is a proud virgin, and I don't understand why people tell me how that's such a great commitment when gay guys are told to not be 'oppressed by the patriarchy.'    
Anyway, everything after is all kinds of screwed up. Again, I've seen all levels of hyperactive paranoid Christian upbringing and how it damages kids, and ESPECIALLY when they're homeschooled. Saving him from temptation? Quoting Matthew 18:6: 
*But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin!* So if you don't want him to look at porn, don't show him porn yourselves. That's what the parents can do, not eliminate everything else in his world that could tempt him. It's up to him whether or not he does it on his own; if you parent well and (**most importantly**) support your kids when they inevitably sin, that's what they should be doing. Not guilt-tripping, ever, and DEFINITELY not running a jail for him. Prayers for him and his family.",None,1438355958.0,Fri Jul 31 17:19:18 2015,11.0,none,"1,398,796",1,,

No self posts, no 'DAE like Tribes?', no imgur posts, no nostalgia posts.  Strictly gaming news, preferably from the bigger sites.  Try to avoid submitting blog spam, even if it's your own website.  If you do decide to submit content from your site, try to make it so it doesn't cover half of the front page.

Mods should be the only ones allowed to make self posts.  I'd allow exceptions if a user has an issue with the subreddit itself, however(douchey mod, rule change or something similar).  But those could be settled through PM's.  

SUMBIT SHIT!  This was one of the biggest issues with /r/gamingnews.  People just didn't submit stuff, and if they did no one upvoted anything.

Can y'all recommend a well supported OpenGL/WebGL solution for Expo?  It seems a lot of popular web library ports (pixi.js, etc.) have brittle support.

Optimally, I'd like to import the video and edit it directly - like I could on a canvas, composite that video with, lets say some kind of drawing, then re-render the composite to a new .mp4 where It would be pumped out to our social media integration API. 

I'd prefer not to use <GLView/> and learn raw OpenGL.

The Israeli military has fostered a climate of impunity in its ranks by failing to thoroughly investigate whether soldiers have killed and injured Palestinian civilians unlawfully or failed to protect them from harm, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

Since the current Palestinian uprising began in 2000, Israeli forces have killed or seriously injured thousands of Palestinians who were not taking part in the hostilities. However, the Israeli authorities have investigated fewer than five percent of the fatal incidents to determine whether soldiers were responsible for using force unlawfully.
